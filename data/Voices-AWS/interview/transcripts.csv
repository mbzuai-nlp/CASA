50fb,INV,17722,21075,school and or work .
50fb,INV,21075,26083,and your participation in community activities .
50fb,INV,26083,26163,okay .
50fb,INV,26163,26363,what do you think causes stuttering ?
50fb,INV,26363,26443,okay .
50fb,INV,26443,26643,&=laughs .
50fb,INV,26643,26723,alright .
50fb,INV,196042,208114,if you have received treatment for your stuttering tell me about  your therapy experiences .
50fb,INV,208114,210400,and the outcomes of these therapies .
50fb,INV,210400,210405,oh .
50fb,INV,210405,210410,oh .
50fb,INV,210410,210415,hm .
50fb,INV,210415,210615,what were some of the therapy strategies or techniques that were  taught ?
50fb,INV,210615,210620,hm .
50fb,INV,416545,436791,<what would you> [//] what would your advice be for someone who  stutters who is considering such a program ?
50fb,INV,459341,467239,&-um how about both scenarios ?
50fb,INV,467239,467244,oh .
50fb,INV,467244,467249,hm .
50fb,INV,467249,467329,yeah .
50fb,INV,467329,467334,hm .
50fb,INV,467334,467339,hm .
50fb,INV,792859,808850,please describe what does successful communication mean to you ?
50fb,INV,808850,817522,and can you provide an example of a positive communicative  experience ?
50fb,INV,928608,946478,if you didn't stutter what might be different in your life ?
50fb,INV,949215,977747,what else would you wanna say to students or the general public to  help them learn about stuttering or ways to support people who  stutter ?
50fb,PAR,26083,50110,my [/] my stutter does not impact my daily life all that much .
50fb,PAR,50110,50310,right now .
50fb,PAR,50310,68552,in that I'm [/] I'm [/] I'm [/] I'm [/] I'm [/] I'm [/] I'm [/] I'm  &-uh very happy .
50fb,PAR,68552,71886,with my work situation .
50fb,PAR,71886,80374,I've got a [/] a [/] a [/] a [/] a [/] a bunch of friends .
50fb,PAR,80374,91214,both from where I currently live and from all of the places that  I've previously lived .
50fb,PAR,91214,99064,and [/] and [/] and I keep up a social schedule that would kill a  horse .
50fb,PAR,99064,128734,&-um &-uh for what I've read it's the [/] the [/] the root cause is  [/] is neurological .
50fb,PAR,128734,151525,and it may be that we process language in a different part of the  brain .
50fb,PAR,151525,154333,that hasn't been optimized for it .
50fb,PAR,154333,180367,there [/] there's [/] there's also some work investigating the  basal ganglia .
50fb,PAR,180367,188657,and [/] and [/] and [/] and [/] and the [/] the [/] the dopamine  levels .
50fb,PAR,188657,196042,and [/] and for the record this is not my field at all .
50fb,PAR,210400,224287,back in the late eighties and early nineties I went through the  fluency shaping wars .
50fb,PAR,224287,225837,several times .
50fb,PAR,225837,243548,and [/] and my [/] my [/] my first round of therapy was a three  week intensive program .
50fb,PAR,243548,243748,I came into there like this .
50fb,PAR,243748,243948,out_of there like this .
50fb,PAR,243948,256670,and four months later I was in [/] in the sub basement .
50fb,PAR,256670,256870,so [/] so [/] so_that huge [/] huge [/] huge whiplash from going in  so low .
50fb,PAR,256870,257070,leaving fluent .
50fb,PAR,257070,309748,and then four months later being [/] being even worse than my  original entry point hurt .
50fb,PAR,309748,320452,and [/] and that was difficult to deal with .
50fb,PAR,320452,346414,it was the [/] the classic precision fluency shaping .
50fb,PAR,346414,355450,where they slow your speech down to two seconds a syllable .
50fb,PAR,355450,355650,and [/] and then you relearn all of the targets .
50fb,PAR,355650,370825,such as prolongation soft contact and easy onset .
50fb,PAR,370825,371025,so for example I would be speaking like that .
50fb,PAR,381481,395143,and then they gradually speed you up to one second a syllable .
50fb,PAR,395143,395343,half a second a syllable .
50fb,PAR,395343,402990,and then something called slow normal .
50fb,PAR,402990,416545,and even slow normal is still noticeably slower than most people's  speech rate .
50fb,PAR,436791,449990,are you [/] you [/] you [/] you [/] you talking about therapy in  general ?
50fb,PAR,449990,459341,or [/] or [/] or [/] or [/] or [/] or just this particular fluency  shaping ?
50fb,PAR,467239,488798,the [/] the fluency shaping gains [/] gains are almost impossible  to both transfer and maintain .
50fb,PAR,488798,516577,because <what they> [/] what they ask of you is to learn this  artificial speaking style .
50fb,PAR,516577,523248,that does not match your usual style .
50fb,PAR,523248,526899,so_that is very difficult .
50fb,PAR,526899,541370,and then what you are expected to do is to monitor every single  syllable that you say for the rest of your life .
50fb,PAR,541370,545490,and nobody can do that .
50fb,PAR,545490,545690,so it's very difficult seeing the gains that you make in the clinic  .
50fb,PAR,545690,578798,and then you [/] you try to transfer them to and maintain them in  the outside world .
50fb,PAR,578798,594748,and [/] and even though some people have been able to do that  spectacularly well .
50fb,PAR,594748,602634,the great majority of people will not be able to .
50fb,PAR,602634,622376,so [/] so that's the single biggest criticism that I have .
50fb,PAR,622376,635533,because it just does not transfer to the outside world .
50fb,PAR,635533,674185,and [/] and [/] and [/] and the new therapy styles <seem to> [/]  seem to [/] to [/] to be a different paradigm .
50fb,PAR,674185,674385,in that the goal is not making you fluent .
50fb,PAR,674385,689869,the goal is making you an easier stutterer .
50fb,PAR,689869,702066,which is a [/] a very different mindset .
50fb,PAR,702066,702266,and [/] and [/] and [/] and [/] and what they [/] they [/] they  seem to focus on +//.
50fb,PAR,702266,702466,although all I know is from just talking to people .
50fb,PAR,702466,741485,rather than any personal experience .
50fb,PAR,741485,757659,<the goal> [/] the goal seems to be working with your existing  style of speech .
50fb,PAR,757659,788691,and [/] and [/] and [/] and [/] and [/] and [/] and [/] and [/] and  making you [/] you [/] you a [/] a [/] a better communicator .
50fb,PAR,788691,792859,although not necessarily a fluent one .
50fb,PAR,817522,831693,&-um basically not being afraid of speaking up .
50fb,PAR,831693,851687,and [/] and [/] and being [/] being able to get your [/] your point  across .
50fb,PAR,851687,857124,in a relatively clear and efficient manner .
50fb,PAR,857124,864075,not necessarily a fluent one .
50fb,PAR,864075,864275,and [/] and [/] and a positive experience is being able to [/] to  talk to my coworkers and discuss very nasty technical problems with  them .
50fb,PAR,864275,913091,and [/] and have the information transfer be [/] be complete .
50fb,PAR,913091,928608,and [/] and [/] and also being able to have good long conversations  with my friends .
50fb,PAR,946478,949215,I honestly can't think of anything .
50fb,PAR,977747,983551,&-um be patient .
50fb,PAR,983551,986883,let the person start .
50fb,PAR,986883,989301,and finish their thought .
50fb,PAR,989301,990887,do not interrupt them .
50fb,PAR,990887,998557,<do not> [/] do not talk over them .
50fb,PAR,998557,1004356,do not fill in their words .
50fb,PAR,1004356,1015814,do not tell them to just relax .
50fb,PAR,1015814,1017549,and it will all be fine .
50fb,PAR,1017549,1025671,because those are two sure fire ways of getting yourself killed .
50fb,PAR,1025671,1029241,in a very ugly and gory fashion .
50fb,PAR,1029241,1048443,and [/] and [/] and if you're speaking on the phone with somebody  who stutters for god's sake don't hang up .
35ma,INV,0,16219,please talk about the impact of stuttering on your daily life you  can talk about your interactions with family and friends school and  or work and your participation in community activities .
35ma,INV,87724,90817,what do you think causes stuttering ?
35ma,INV,153968,164279,if you have received treatment for your stuttering tell me about  your therapy experiences and the outcomes of these therapies ?
35ma,INV,245447,256074,please describe what successful communication means to you and can  you give an example of a positive communicative experience ?

35ma,INV,342856,355257,what else would you wanna say to students or the general public to  help them learn about stuttering or ways to support people who  stutter ?
35ma,INV,361657,372202,for [/] for students or the general public so people who don't know  much about stuttering .
35ma,INV,372202,372402,thank you very much .
35ma,PAR,16219,34667,it's very difficult and I'm trying to [/] to avoid some stressful  situations .
35ma,PAR,34667,41033,interactions .
35ma,PAR,41033,50342,so I would xxx say a huge impact on [/] on my life .
35ma,PAR,50342,82393,and <it's hard> [/] it's hard for me to maintain the relations with  friends (be)cause I don't like to make phone calls checking up on  them .
35ma,PAR,82393,87724,so yeah .
35ma,PAR,90817,100057,I'm pretty sure it's stressful situations .
35ma,PAR,100057,121116,and like <it's it's> [/] it's weird (be)cause when I talk to people  I know well I stutter less .
35ma,PAR,121116,127866,oh and with strangers I stutter more .
35ma,PAR,127866,148069,and also I don't stutter when I whisper or [/] or sing or when I'm  like angry .
35ma,PAR,148069,151914,I don't .
35ma,PAR,151914,153968,yeah so .
35ma,PAR,164279,173939,I took a few therapies .
35ma,PAR,173939,174139,and it [/] it looked like <I was> [/] I was practicing speech tools  .
35ma,PAR,174139,210152,the therapies I was I [/] I was reading aloud and clearly to keep  the right tempo of my speech .
35ma,PAR,210152,242923,and you_know but after therapy <I I> [/] I was speaking fluent but  then right after coming back home it came back to my normal speech  of stuttering .
35ma,PAR,242923,245447,yeah .
35ma,PAR,256074,274726,successful communication is <when you can> [/] when you can say  anything anytime with no struggling .
35ma,PAR,274726,274926,that would be .
35ma,PAR,274926,308064,xxx and also sometimes I have moments when I [/] I can make a phone  call for a few minutes and speaking fluently .
35ma,PAR,308064,317320,so those are my successes in speech .
35ma,PAR,317320,317520,I would have a different job .
35ma,PAR,323789,334285,I [/] I would graduate some better school .
35ma,PAR,334285,334485,and I guess I would have more friends .
35ma,PAR,335370,342856,so it would be huge .
35ma,PAR,355257,361657,for people who stutter or for students ?
35ma,PAR,372202,392656,okay so definitely people who stutter are as much intelligent as  those who don't .
35ma,PAR,392656,403501,and they are pretty normal people except speech difficulty .
35ma,PAR,403501,408801,I guess that's all .
35ma,PAR,408801,409001,thank you .
35ma,PAR,409001,411923,thank you .

24fc,INV,431986,440775,&-uh so the last thing is &-uh very important .
24fc,INV,440775,440975,because_of the project .
24fc,INV,440975,441175,is there anything that you would like to say .
24fc,INV,441175,447143,to students who are studying to become speech pathologists .
24fc,INV,447143,448861,who might work with people who stutter ?
24fc,INV,448861,449061,well you had some things told to you .
24fc,INV,449061,449261,that didn't help .
24fc,INV,498083,500446,right ?
24fc,PAR,14271,19791,&-um I would say that it has impacted my life .
24fc,PAR,19791,25527,&-um <I> [//] when I was like younger in school .
24fc,PAR,25527,33231,I will hate to do like the oral presentation .
24fc,PAR,33231,41734,and I will even ask my [/] &-um my [/] my teacher .
24fc,PAR,41734,47687,<to> [//] like either to not do them .
24fc,PAR,47687,50271,or to do it like in front of him only .
24fc,PAR,50271,50351,or her .
24fc,PAR,50351,50431,only .
24fc,PAR,50431,54154,instead of in front of everybody else .
24fc,PAR,54154,59426,&-um it didn't impact me for like my like friendship .
24fc,PAR,59426,61611,my friends just don't care .
24fc,PAR,61611,64378,<they are> [/] they are so sweet .
24fc,PAR,64378,64578,&-um my family member too .
24fc,PAR,64578,69755,&-uh they just wanna like help me .
24fc,PAR,69755,73166,and I know it's been hard for them .
24fc,PAR,73166,73366,it was all like new things .
24fc,PAR,73366,73566,they didn't know <how> [//] what to what [/] what [/] what to do .
24fc,PAR,73566,83537,or like how [/] how they could like help me .
24fc,PAR,83537,83737,but <we all> [//] we get all through [/] through [/] through [/]  through it .
24fc,PAR,83737,83937,and &-um as part of my like job +//.
24fc,PAR,83937,98194,&-um I recently &-uh got a job .
24fc,PAR,98194,98394,and I pass one interview .
24fc,PAR,98394,98594,and <I got> [//] I [/] I got it .
24fc,PAR,98594,103595,so .
24fc,PAR,103595,103795,I wouldn't say it has impacted me .
24fc,PAR,103795,103995,I'm pretty confident .
24fc,PAR,103995,113234,so .
24fc,PAR,113234,113434,I think it just like pass through it .
24fc,PAR,113434,113634,and it's just okay fine .
24fc,PAR,113634,113834,like it's okay .
24fc,PAR,113834,121990,so .
24fc,PAR,121990,122190,&-um yes I did .
24fc,PAR,131694,136095,when I was younger .
24fc,PAR,136095,141849,so like for &-uh like when I was like six to when I was like  eighteen .
24fc,PAR,141849,147175,I had the therapy .
24fc,PAR,147175,147375,on and off .
24fc,PAR,147375,147455,some +//.
24fc,PAR,147455,147655,I will go .
24fc,PAR,147655,151119,then I will just stop .
24fc,PAR,151119,154104,because it wasn't helping me really much .
24fc,PAR,154104,154304,&-um I am a fast talker .
24fc,PAR,154304,162288,so people will always to have me go like slow down .
24fc,PAR,162288,162488,and I would hate that .
24fc,PAR,162488,165743,I cannot slow down .
24fc,PAR,165743,167789,<I> [//] I'm not able to .
24fc,PAR,167789,171913,so I would just hate to like talk really slow .
24fc,PAR,171913,176422,and trying to put that in my real life afterward .
24fc,PAR,176422,176622,and it would just feel weird .
24fc,PAR,176622,181901,&-um so I did therapy .
24fc,PAR,181901,187336,I did not appreciate it really much .
24fc,PAR,187336,197042,what has helped me is to meet other people who stutter .
24fc,PAR,197042,197242,&-uh to talk with them .
24fc,PAR,197242,202844,see how they live with it .
24fc,PAR,202844,203044,and <that> [//] that's what helped me the most .
24fc,PAR,203044,203244,to gain my confidence .
24fc,PAR,203244,210892,like confidence back .
24fc,PAR,223418,232115,I would say would just be that if two people can understand  each_other .
24fc,PAR,232115,232315,that is the main point .
24fc,PAR,232315,232395,for me .
24fc,PAR,232395,239590,to have like a good conversation .
24fc,PAR,239590,239790,&-um also it would just +//.
24fc,PAR,239790,250600,I [/] I don't think that the fluency like has like a role to play  in that .
24fc,PAR,250600,250800,it [/] it would help of course .
24fc,PAR,250800,263556,it's easier <for the> [/] for the people to like understand us .
24fc,PAR,263556,266357,<if we> [/] if we don't block .
24fc,PAR,266357,272227,but I think that &-uh <if the> [//] if I can say what I hafta say .
24fc,PAR,272227,272427,and that I [/] I don't like switch word .
24fc,PAR,272427,281614,or stop [/] stop before I finish what I wanna say .
24fc,PAR,281614,286384,that is a good conversation .
24fc,PAR,286384,286464,I did .
24fc,PAR,286464,286664,I did think &-uh if my job <would be> [/] would be like the same  job .
24fc,PAR,286664,286864,if it would like xxx my choice .
24fc,PAR,286864,287064,I love what I do .
24fc,PAR,287064,287264,but maybe that I would have chosen like something else .
24fc,PAR,287264,287464,that I might hafta talk more .
24fc,PAR,287464,316647,or might hafta interact with people more .
24fc,PAR,316647,316847,I do hafta interact with like people at my job .
24fc,PAR,316847,322551,but I don't interact with like other people .
24fc,PAR,322551,322751,it's just like my team .
24fc,PAR,322751,322951,my like teammate .
24fc,PAR,322951,325875,the coworkers .
24fc,PAR,325875,329883,but I don't hafta like call someone .
24fc,PAR,329883,336991,or like so maybe <I would have got> [//] I would have &-um gotten  another kind of job .
24fc,PAR,336991,337191,but I think I would be pretty much the same .
24fc,PAR,337191,344677,<I might have> [//] I might would have &-um talk more .
24fc,PAR,344677,347247,like when I'm like in group .
24fc,PAR,347247,347447,I think it's my cellphone .
24fc,PAR,347447,347527,buzzing .
24fc,PAR,347527,347727,&-um so I think I would talk maybe more .
24fc,PAR,347727,355250,<when I'm> [/] when I'm in group .
24fc,PAR,355250,361703,I find it &-uh difficult to &-um like take my place .
24fc,PAR,361703,361903,when people talk .
24fc,PAR,361903,364671,and they're talking pretty fast sometimes .
24fc,PAR,364671,364871,and it's just hard to just like say stop .
24fc,PAR,364871,370588,<I want> [/] I wanna like say something .
24fc,PAR,370588,370668,about .
24fc,PAR,370668,370868,and I know that I'm gonna block .
24fc,PAR,370868,371068,and that it's gonna be long .
24fc,PAR,371068,379109,and so I think it would maybe xxx .
24fc,PAR,379109,382679,but my friends are pretty <good> [//] cool with that .
24fc,PAR,382679,382879,so they let me talk to .
24fc,PAR,382879,382884,so .
24fc,PAR,382884,383084,&=laughs .
24fc,PAR,388616,394903,&-uh I am doing a master in biology .
24fc,PAR,394903,395103,so of course I looked it up .
24fc,PAR,395103,401284,&-uh so I know it's like gene .
24fc,PAR,401284,401484,like &-uh involved in that .
24fc,PAR,401484,401684,it's like eighty percent like genetic .
24fc,PAR,401684,408509,twenty percent environmental .
24fc,PAR,408509,408709,&-uh I look it up for which gene .
24fc,PAR,408709,408789,and why .
24fc,PAR,408789,416896,how [/] how does that work ?
24fc,PAR,416896,417096,&-uh I know that we do not all of them yet .
24fc,PAR,416896,425182,and they all work in the same pathways .
24fc,PAR,417096,417296,we have a really few of them .
24fc,PAR,425182,431986,so I can't wait to see like really what causes that .
24fc,PAR,431986,432066,yeah .
24fc,PAR,432066,432266,&-uh I would say +//.
24fc,PAR,432266,432466,I think that the most important thing .
24fc,PAR,448861,465719,is that the people who stutter &-um like [/] like the kind of  therapy that they are getting .
24fc,PAR,465719,465919,so maybe like ask them .
24fc,PAR,465919,466119,like more often .
24fc,PAR,466119,471339,if [/] if [/] if this is what they want .
24fc,PAR,471339,471539,to like [/] like try .
24fc,PAR,471539,475925,or like practice .
24fc,PAR,475925,476125,or things like that .
24fc,PAR,476125,476325,&-um maybe to ask them &-uh if like +//.
24fc,PAR,476325,476525,more about like maybe like school .
24fc,PAR,476525,490047,like if everything is like good at school .
24fc,PAR,490047,493549,what [/] what [/] what would help them .
24fc,PAR,493549,494982,what would not help them .
24fc,PAR,494982,495182,so I think that +//.
24fc,PAR,495182,495262,yeah .
24fc,PAR,495262,498083,pretty much it .
507,INV,0,5797,yeah okay &-um please talk about the impact of stuttering on your  daily life .
507,INV,5797,12755,you can talk about your interactions with family and friends school  and or work and your participation in community activities .
507,INV,115435,115840,B;FG;1
507,INV,287923,292823,&-um and participation in community activities .
507,INV,299200,300104,yeah .
507,INV,479583,485084,yeah okay &-um what do you think causes stuttering ?
507,INV,530081,537648,&-um if you have received treatment for your stuttering tell me  about your therapy experiences and the outcomes of these therapies .
507,INV,576911,586043,&-uh please describe what successful communication means to you can  you give an example of a positive communicative experience ?
507,INV,592763,598000,if you didn't stutter what might be different in your life ?
507,INV,670371,678970,and this is the last question what else would you want to say to  students or the general public to help them learn about stuttering  to help them learn about stuttering or ways to support people who  stutter ?
507,INV,678970,679170,yeah perfect so that's it for the questions thank you so much .
507,PAR,12755,22392,yeah &-um as far as my daily life goes &-uh it's pretty much  affected every part of it .
507,PAR,22392,32276,because I &-uh when I was eighteen I was I attempted to join the  national guard .
507,PAR,32276,45392,and &-uh I the recruiter after going to &-uh take the test &-uh he  walked up to me and he said &-uh &-uh you scored so high on the  ASVAP you can have any job you want .
507,PAR,45392,51091,but you can't join because you stutter the doctor will no waiver  stutter on your form .
507,PAR,51091,71628,and so &-uh right there &-uh right after high school my &-uh an  immediate &-uh &-uh an immediate job discrimination right out_of the  gates .
507,PAR,71628,82083,so &-uh so my daily life was immediately altered from that day in  two thousand four .
507,PAR,82083,99331,so I probably wouldn't have the daily life I have now if it wasn't  for my speech so &-uh &-um I now work but &-uh I now work for the  department of children and family services .
507,PAR,99331,103496,I do background checks for daycare centers agencies and  institutions .
507,PAR,103496,114550,&-uh &-um I with my job it's I'm in front of a computer all day .
507,PAR,114550,121578,and I don't hafta talk to anybody unless I have a question about  an application or a procedure going forward .
507,PAR,121578,135133,&-uh I mainly use FBI and Illinois state police databases to  research including child abuse .
507,PAR,135133,145567,&-um hold on a second &-uh &-um &-uh and child abuse and neglect  tracking systems .
507,PAR,145567,153544,so it's I learned about the job and I discovered there wasn't much  speech involved .
507,PAR,153544,173384,so I transferred from the department of human services which I was  in direct care of &-um of clients who were NGRI in USC which is not  guilty by reason of insanity and not fit to stand trial .
507,PAR,173384,180983,&-uh these were adults &-um in a twenty four seven care facility .
507,PAR,180983,194100,and &-uh and I think having a speech impediment &-uh it helped me  empathize with &-uh the clientele that we were assisting with .
507,PAR,194100,212202,&-uh there were a few who had similar speech impediments &-uh some  just connected with me because I was maybe thought as other as he  was .
507,PAR,212202,222484,&-um &-uh and then COVID hit and I started to work the positive  Covid units on top of NGR .
507,PAR,222484,228434,NGRI and USC and it just became too much so I transferred to the  department of children and family services .
507,PAR,228434,245687,and &-uh so I have a much more limited speaking role because it's  in more computer work all day and &-uh so it's a very low stress  concerning speech .
507,PAR,245687,258415,as far as &-uh friends and family &-uh I surround myself with &-uh  friends who &-uh who aren't worried about my speech &-uh .
507,PAR,258415,260300,they accept me for who I am .
507,PAR,260300,269535,&-uh family &-uh &-um I have not seen much of them lately .
507,PAR,269535,277487,&-uh partly due to Covid and moving to Chicago three hundred miles  away from home .
507,PAR,277487,284553,I have not been back home in four years so &-uh I haven't really  seen them much &-uh .
507,PAR,284553,287923,&-uh so work family friends what was the other ?
507,PAR,292823,299200,oh yeah and &-um and how speech has effected community activities .
507,PAR,300104,321886,&-um &-uh yeah if hobbies are a part of community activities &-uh  &-um from eighteen to thirty two I was competing in Amuteur  automobile racing .
507,PAR,321886,325737,at the &-um with the sports car club of America SCCA .
507,PAR,325737,336971,&-uh &-um my in my late twenties I became full time reginal  champion of auto cross and Renocross in my region .
507,PAR,336971,342520,and then in two thousand sixteen I placed fifth at the national  Renocross championship .
507,PAR,342520,348217,&-uh &-um I think forty eight out_of fifty states were represented  .
507,PAR,348217,358689,so &-uh and it's having a speech impediment in that hobby &-um was  a bit of a challenge .
507,PAR,358689,378367,because the [/] the type of people who compete in that &-uh tend to  be &-um well clear &-um caucasian male very daunting personalities .
507,PAR,378367,393656,&-uh and it's just &-uh the type of personalities I would not  voluntarily be around .
507,PAR,393656,397174,&-um a_lot_of high egos .
507,PAR,397174,405808,&-uh so to start off and to learn how to race was a bit of a  challenge .
507,PAR,405808,415185,it took me extra time a few more years than it should have because  &-uh there were barriers and hurdles .
507,PAR,415185,427570,&-uh to finally become an accepted &-uh member of the local chapter  of the SCCA .
507,PAR,427570,435274,&-uh eventually I gotta know the in and out_of the sport .
507,PAR,435274,445990,and fellow competitors and learn from their abilities and &-uh then  &-uh went to racing schools and that's where I got good finally .
507,PAR,445990,457058,&-uh yeah so it's having a speech impediment just adds hurdles but  you can do pretty much what you want to do .
507,PAR,457058,465675,&-uh at the NSA conference last week there were guys in the  military who stuttered .
507,PAR,465675,471275,they said that I probably just had a bad doctor that I the doctor  was probably just having a bad day that day .
507,PAR,471275,479583,and just didn't want to I don't know or maybe he was just a jerk so  yeah so &-um yeah .
507,PAR,485084,490188,&-uh I assume it's genetic .
507,PAR,490188,501759,&-uh it's probably a physiological &-uh thing both mind and body .
507,PAR,501759,519046,&-uh I've heard some &-uh maybe your transmitters from your brain  aren't sending the right messages to your muscles .
507,PAR,519046,530081,&-uh it's genetics &-uh I don't know I don't think a_lot_of people  know so .
507,PAR,537648,543677,&-uh through ninth grade I went to speech therapy .
507,PAR,543677,550011,&-uh I was taken out_of class read sentences &-uh .
507,PAR,550011,554494,I was told to slow down &-uh now .
507,PAR,554494,563992,that was she had a good heart &-uh the speech therapist &-uh I what  I got out_of it was a person to talk to .
507,PAR,563992,576911,&-uh as far as the speech therapy &-uh I don't think it was  productive in it made it better it was productive in that I had an  adult to talk to .
507,PAR,586043,592763,&-uh &-um positive no .
507,PAR,598000,603458,&-uh my occupation for sure &-uh for sure .
507,PAR,603458,616414,&-uh the equal opportunity had upward mobility .
507,PAR,616414,629228,&-um I imagine I would it's altered everything so .
507,PAR,629228,641029,&-uh whether its good or bad I am thankful now I look back and I  wasn't able to get into the military because that was the height of  the Iraq war .
507,PAR,641029,645278,I may have been killed in Iraq if I got in .
507,PAR,645278,649729,so maybe this is &-uh a positive thing I didn't get in .
507,PAR,649729,655209,&-uh so that's it a very loaded question &-uh yeah .
507,PAR,655209,670371,&-um yeah it's I'm I had a hard I'm doing a lot better with it now  and so yeah .
507,PAR,678970,683837,&-uh yeah just take time listen &-um .
507,PAR,683837,700571,make eye contact and &-uh it's I &-um you may feel a sense of  discomfort to listen but &-uh you can get over it .
507,PAR,700571,707409,yeah it's easier for it's not on me to speak better it's on you to  listen better .
507,PAR,707409,713389,&-uh and treat everyone with dignity and respect and yeah .
507,PAR,713389,717104,sure !
28m,PAR,21041,29721,I mean I feel that it's pretty prominent in any relationship you  have whether its simply you know .
28m,PAR,29721,32306,you're a waiter at a restaurant up to a family member .
28m,PAR,32306,41767,communication is the most important part of that and a breakdown of  that for me at least in my experience affects the quality of the  relationship .
28m,PAR,41767,44967,so &-um you know &-um .
28m,PAR,44967,59892,I don't know like I work and the job I have doesn't require much  speaking and I think its tough for me to convince a prospective  employer that I can do a job that involves speaking on the phone and  meeting with clients and that's the way I like to challenge myself .
28m,PAR,59892,73045,&-um and I think its hard to maybe prove my competence at work when  I have a difficult time speaking or expressing myself &-um and when  I was in school .
28m,PAR,73045,74673,&-um it was .
28m,PAR,74673,90724,you know especially in classes where there was a_lot_of focus on  discussion or participating and that was very stressful and that was  hard for me to &-um fully &-uh participate to the extent that I  wanted to .
28m,PAR,90724,95075,&-um and &-uh .
28m,PAR,95075,99382,but you know I mean I guess I try to think of the positives too and  &-uh .
28m,PAR,99382,101706,you know I think &-uh .
28m,PAR,101706,107710,you really realize that you don't take speech for granted so you  know you realize the value of being able to express yourself .
28m,PAR,107710,117512,and you can &-um &-uh and I think you can try to say things that  have more meaning instead of just rambling .
28m,PAR,123241,130358,well we know its I mean it varies for person to person I mean but I  think its for most cases neurological .
28m,PAR,130358,150578,&-um I actually participated in an e@l [/] e@l g@l study recently  where they were trying to identify what part in the brain stuttering  occurs and differences in the brains from people who stutter from  those who don't and for some people its more motor and for some  people its more sensory and I guess the idea of this is that they  could target speech .
28m,PAR,150578,156452,therapy you know based on the root causality from ones particular  case .
28m,PAR,156452,163779,&-um and then you know well I just learned in this conference its  up to as many as twenty percent .
28m,PAR,163779,168202,cases can be genetic but in my case it doesn't run in the family  and I am the only one .
28m,PAR,168202,179393,&-um and then two of those can be psychological I mean I have heard  stories of people coming back from a war and having p@l t@l s@l d@l  and stuttering as two of the symptoms .
28m,PAR,179393,189520,the I mean I think those &-um you know people might stutter in the  same way but its interesting to see how there is a whole spectrum of  causes .
28m,PAR,203519,211185,&-um I have been to so well first of all I didn't start stuttering  at all until I was eighteen .
28m,PAR,211185,219830,its been &-uh I think it made my experience and relationship to  stuttering a bit different than a_lot_of people I've met here .
28m,PAR,219830,226199,&-um so I first got therapy when I was nineteen so it was the  summer after my freshman year of college and .
28m,PAR,226199,238608,&-um it was just a standard you know weekly sessions and at that  point I was so new to the whole thing and I've never seen a speech  therapist before .
28m,PAR,238608,248486,so I didn't know what to expect and she wasn't a bad therapist but  I don't think I was fully knew what I was getting myself into or  knew how to get the most out_of it .
28m,PAR,248486,266936,and then I did on two more occasions I worked one on one with a  therapist and I never I don't know I never really found that to be  successful and especially the second two people I worked with I  didn't have a good report with &-um and then I have done two  intensive programs as well .
28m,PAR,266936,270495,did one at Bowling Green in Ohio .
28m,PAR,270495,290266,&-uh done by Rodney Gobble who I was really impressed with and the  focus was definitely on stuttering modification and that is when I  was first introduced to the idea of acceptance and desensitizing and  things like voluntary stuttering so_that was an interesting  experience and .
28m,PAR,290266,293458,that was the first time I had a chance to meet other people who  stutter .
28m,PAR,293458,303533,and then on the other end of the spectrum I did Hollins a couple of  years later which is very much the fluency shape idea and &-uh that  was a positive experience too .
28m,PAR,303533,323903,I think being you know especially since I didn't start stuttering  until I was eighteen I mean the idea of acceptance is very hard for  me (be)cause its not something I really truly think of as part  myself that's organic to me so going to a place like Hollands and  being told it was actually behavioral and that I could control and  have some autonomy over was very appealing to me .
28m,PAR,323903,330552,but &-um I think the reality was its really tough to implement the  strategies in my day to day life .
28m,PAR,330552,340937,&-um and then I am active in an n@l s@l a@l chapter in Chicago  which I have been for about three years which I go pretty much every  month and that's been a really encouraging experience and then .
28m,PAR,340937,343956,the conference is great too and this is my third time coming here .
28m,PAR,356742,365637,that's a tough one because I would love to say its simply a matter  of saying what you wanna say and that its more important .
28m,PAR,365637,367698,&-um what .
28m,PAR,367698,382685,you say than how you say it but I don't think that's fully true you  know its something as simple as saying thank you to somebody saying  it like that or saying it with a large amount of box the same words  in the dictionary but its communication very differently and there's  so much muscle used in communication and just .
28m,PAR,382685,384211,the words you choose .
28m,PAR,384211,390617,but I think its truly being in control and saying not only what you  wanna say but in the manner you wanna say it too .
28m,PAR,390617,396553,but I think that's why I feel stutter has been a hindrance to  successful communication .
28m,PAR,406561,417681,&-um just in general I guess when I feel that the person I am  speaking with that we're understanding each_other and we are on the  same wavelength and that &-uh .
28m,PAR,417681,423503,there isn't that sort of confusion where we're not quite sure what  the other person is saying .
28m,PAR,423503,430153,and even with a stutter that is possible but it can obviously be  more challenging .
28m,PAR,441009,450420,I mean for me I don't really hafta speculate because for the first  eighteen years of my life I didn't stutter .
28m,PAR,450420,455626,and &-uh &-um .
28m,PAR,455626,478907,and &-uh so I just compare myself to the way I was then and the way  I was now I was so much more confident and had a lot more of a  social life then and especially when I gotta college and started  stuttering I lost a_lot_of that and now its kind of a matter of  trying to get that all back .
28m,PAR,478907,497076,&-um and it you know it I think with my success professionally and  socially I think I probably have an easier time then I do now and  its not to say that everything would be perfect if I .
28m,PAR,497076,502333,I didn't stutter you know and there would still be challenges and  things like that and &-um .
28m,PAR,502333,503829,but &-um .
28m,PAR,503829,519392,and I guess also to that what helps me to think about positive  experiences that I wouldn't have had if I didn't stutter .
28m,PAR,519392,527407,for example I come into conferences like this and its kind of the  pinnacle of that and you know if I didn't stutter I wouldn't get to  experience something like this .
28m,PAR,540258,566728,I think the way I would want any listener to interpret stuttering  is just to its just a form of diversity and not everybody  communicates the same way and the same way we are encouraged to  celebrate racial or ethic diversity we should embrace stuttering and  other ways of communicating as well and instead of seeing it as  something wrong with that person .
28m,PAR,566728,573897,I can as a stutterer myself I can be frustrated but I don't think  its the listener that gets to do that .
28m,PAR,573897,593667,&-um and then you know for a student of speech pathology just to  make sure you view your client as not just a client but as a full  person I think its important to take the time to get to know them  not just as a case study but as an actual human being that you can  form a genuine connection with .
28m,PAR,611225,629227,you know just as a society we are so wired to want everything with  instant gratification and you know I think a_lot_of its to  technology you want a question and you just pull out your phone and  google it and the answer is right at your fingertips I think we  expect that with speech as well .
28m,PAR,629227,630796,just to &-um .
28m,PAR,630796,641619,realize that its okay if there's a little bit of a delay and not  everything is going to come right away and some things are worth  waiting for and .
28m,PAR,641619,643118,put in extra effort .
28m,INV,0,8779,please talk about the impact of stuttering on your daily life .
28m,INV,8779,13600,you can talk about your interactions with family and friends .
28m,INV,13600,21041,school and or work and your participation in community activities .
28m,INV,117512,123241,what do you think causes stuttering ?
28m,INV,189520,203519,if you ever seek treatment for your stuttering tell me about your  therapy experiences and the outcomes of these therapies .
28m,INV,343956,356742,please describe what successful communication means to you .
28m,INV,396553,406561,can you give an example of a positive communicative experience ?
28m,INV,430153,441009,if you didn't stutter what might be different in your life ?
28m,INV,527407,540258,is there anything you wanna say to students or the general public  to help them learn about stuttering ?
28m,INV,593667,611225,and &-um is there anything &-uh any other ways that you think  students or the general public and support those who stutter ?
43m,PAR,16943,22943,&-um in terms of impact I wouldn't say it has an impact actually .
43m,PAR,22943,27470,&-uh I think it useta impact me much more .
43m,PAR,27470,35474,it useta keep me doing a_lot_of activities I wanted to do .
43m,PAR,35474,35674,and I would say that change probably around mid high school time  maybe college time .
43m,PAR,35674,46021,&-uh xxx I think by college it had stopped holding me back .
43m,PAR,46021,46221,&-um at this point in time I really just enjoy the fact that I  stutter .
43m,PAR,46221,46421,I enjoy people's responses .
43m,PAR,46421,70885,I really actually am entertained by the facial expressions I get  when I'm putting on a little bit more and people provide faces that  you could almost see out_of a Saturday_Night_Live skit .
43m,PAR,70885,71085,it's really funny .
43m,PAR,71085,74646,it shouldn't be but it really is .
43m,PAR,74646,74846,&-um I would say it doesn't inhibit anything it just helps .
43m,PAR,74846,75046,it provides an added help to allow others to feel a lot more  comfortable with me .
43m,PAR,75046,75246,so as a therapist as a social worker as a supervisor as a presenter  as a speaker .
43m,PAR,75246,75446,however you wanna look at it .
43m,PAR,75446,103155,people tend to open up to me quite a lot faster .
43m,PAR,103155,107901,&-um and are much more open to what I hafta say .
43m,PAR,107901,108101,it also is an amazing thing in court because judges zero in on  exactly what I'm saying .
43m,PAR,108101,125952,and often has actually made my &-uh my comments towards clients  hold more ground which is great .
43m,PAR,127255,129358,that's about it .
43m,PAR,133103,137414,how many things are there that can cause stuttering &-uh ?
43m,PAR,137414,140188,anxiety &-um .
43m,PAR,140188,143530,depression at times .
43m,PAR,143530,143730,&-um I think anxiety <is> [//] has a major impact .
43m,PAR,143730,152353,&-um I think hormones can have a major impact .
43m,PAR,152353,156214,&-um &-uh in a variety of ways .
43m,PAR,156214,174696,&-um &-uh I've heard several times and read a little bit of  research <that there was> [//] &-uh for those who stutter there's a  tenth of a second delay in terms of when you speak and when you hear  your own voice .
43m,PAR,174696,179295,xxx calls it some type of disconnect .
43m,PAR,179295,179495,I think it really is different depending on the person what each  person has been through what each person has experienced any traumas  that anyone has been through any brain issues anything .
43m,PAR,179495,205330,any type of diagnosis known to mankind can some way have some type  of effect I think lead to the potential of stuttering .
43m,PAR,205330,205530,where do I begin [=! laughing] ?
43m,PAR,217027,226569,&-um I've probably had at least twenty plus speech therapists over  time .
43m,PAR,226569,226769,&-um I will say there's one <nationally> [//] internationally known  guy named <Charles &-uh &-um> [//] what was his name .
43m,PAR,226769,243915,&-uh Charles_Lastname I think his name was .
43m,PAR,243915,244115,&-um <who had an incredible> [//] who helped tremendously .
43m,PAR,244115,255079,yes <Charles> [//] Doctor_Charles_Lastname .
43m,PAR,255079,255279,who really had a tremendous impact on me .
43m,PAR,255279,261597,both on early age and then again &-uh during college .
43m,PAR,261597,261797,aside from that most of the speech therapists I had did not help at  all .
43m,PAR,261797,268398,in fact a lot made it worse .
43m,PAR,268398,268598,&-um I did also attend the Starbucks_Fluency_Clinic &-um at age  thirteen and then at age fourteen and then came back as a refresher  for a few years and mentor for a couple years .
43m,PAR,268598,289220,and I believe it is no longer in existence .
43m,PAR,289220,305780,&-um but that program was &-uh was helpful in a_lot_of ways <to  get> [//] to reduce my fear of speaking in public &-uh because it  forced you to which now has lead to one of my jobs which is being a  public speaker .
43m,PAR,305780,322043,&-um but unfortunately I think there is not enough understanding of  stuttering and for that reason it is imperative that a person who  stutters finds a speech therapist who really understands stuttering  .
43m,PAR,322043,329945,&-uh as opposed to someone who attempts to understand but really  doesn't and can end up screwing up clients even more .
43m,PAR,342644,351669,hm: communication is any way that thoughts or actions are being  perceived .
43m,PAR,351669,371355,&-um effective communication I would say is when a person speaking  or acting is able to convey his or her thoughts effectively to the  person receiving those comments thoughts or what have you .
43m,PAR,373495,390425,clearly being a social worker and therapist &-uh communication  becomes of the utmost importance of making sure that each client  feels heard and understood .
43m,PAR,390425,399948,I think in life communication becomes the way of the world because  if you're not understood you feel highly left out .
43m,PAR,399948,409841,therefore it becomes of the essence to make sure you can &-uh  project what you want others to know and understand about you .
43m,PAR,409841,435661,I think it can be exceptionally painful for <those who feel unable  or feel> [//] those who feel they have that hard of a time being  able to communicate because it's such a profound part of society  that is not &-um being utilized .
43m,PAR,441778,443849,everything &-uh [=! laughing] .
43m,PAR,443849,446021,life would be boring .
43m,PAR,446021,449564,life would be very boring .
43m,PAR,449564,457084,<&-um I'm> [//] granted personality aside I think I would find out  there are ways to be entertained .
43m,PAR,457084,457284,but it provides me with so much entertainment and so many  interesting things <that I think I would> [//] I don't think I would  be nearly as happy .
43m,PAR,457284,471841,I don't think I would be nearly as fulfilled .
43m,PAR,471841,476821,I don't think I would be as culturally competent .
43m,PAR,476821,481683,I do not think I would be nearly as good in my own profession .
43m,PAR,481683,484609,so it would suck .
43m,PAR,496348,510126,ah don't be overly too sensitive or insensitive .
43m,PAR,510126,511380,be yourself .
43m,PAR,511380,514637,and I'm saying that as the person who doesn't stutter .
43m,PAR,514637,514837,be who you are and without being overly what's the word I'm looking  for &-uh excessively supportive .
43m,PAR,514837,515037,I think <some do need> [//] a_lot_of people who stutter do need  a_lot_of extra support but I think it can also become a very big  crutch .
43m,PAR,515037,552373,and if you're in society if you're in this world you hafta be able  to combat whatever comes at you or you will be in a victim mentality  .
43m,PAR,552373,560376,and the fact is you needta be in a survivors mentality regardless  of what your issues or background is .
43m,PAR,560376,566846,&-um therefore to just treat those who stutter like every other  person because they are .
43m,PAR,566846,567046,like every other person .
43m,PAR,567046,571306,they just have an extra gift .

24ma,PAR,43419,51542,and (.) I am an s@l l@l p@l student so I [//] it's kind of okay for  me to &-like stutter in that environment .

24ma,PAR,203295,209898,&-um well I mean the exact cause is unknown .
24ma,PAR,209898,216051,I mean from what I know it's like a neurological and physiological  disorder .
24ma,PAR,216051,220487,so I mean it could be genetics .
24ma,PAR,220487,226323,<yeah I don't> [/] yeah I don't think there's an exact cause so  +...
24ma,PAR,240661,244490,if I've ever had therapy is that the question ?
24ma,PAR,244490,258354,so I've had speech therapy for about a year and the thing that was  most helpful was the [//] &-um my speech therapist told me about the  n@l s@l a@l .
24ma,PAR,258354,258554,it's &-like the acceptance .
24ma,PAR,258554,263639,&-like that was like the most important thing .
24ma,PAR,263639,263839,and (.) she taught me these techniques .
24ma,PAR,263839,274328,&-you_know like &-um easy onset and prolongations and stuff but I  don't really use it that much .
24ma,PAR,274328,278161,but I feel like I do have a slower rate of speech .
24ma,PAR,278161,278361,so maybe &-like that's a technique .
24ma,PAR,278361,278561,&-um I view it as positive because it allowed me to be more open  about it and accepting and (.) &-um (.) I would have all these  different &-like secondary behaviors .

24ma,PAR,328937,332169,it doesn't affect me as much I guess .
24ma,PAR,332169,335841,&-um yeah .
24ma,PAR,358979,368758,successful communication I guess that would mean getting your  message across &-um .

32m,PAR,64294,72268,and since she's been to a &-uh meeting she knows what they go  through because_of what I go through .
32m,PAR,72268,80054,<so it's nice to have your back &-uh> [//] it's nice to have family  that has your back .
32m,PAR,85209,94873,&-um that's kind of a hard question to answer .
32m,PAR,94873,112477,<but I think it's> [//] I don't know if this is I don't know if  this answers the question but what makes my stutter worst is unknown  situations .
32m,PAR,121352,127341,talking about my past experiences that have been extremely negative  but sometimes I can talk to my parents or friends about the most  mundane things or things that I love and care about and my stutter  will be out_of hand .
32m,PAR,130002,145026,and sometimes I can talk about the hardest thing and my stutter  will [/] will be just fine .
32m,PAR,145026,149388,so I'm not really sure what causes stuttering .
32m,PAR,168338,172861,I've only had one therapeutic experience and that was when I was in  elementary school .
32m,PAR,172861,178916,and the teacher was actually at the elementary school .
32m,PAR,178916,186314,&-um but the lessons I've learned was to like breath through the  stutter .
32m,PAR,196320,198069,and as far as I know that was probably the biggest lesson I got  from her .
32m,PAR,198069,204580,&-um I've never wanted to go to speech therapy as an adult .
32m,PAR,208424,213098,I feel I have a handle on it .
32m,PAR,213098,222608,and <I don't wanna> [/] I don't wanna be like +...
32m,PAR,229341,234280,I don't to have somebody trying I know there's no cure for  stuttering but trying to make it better but trying to make it better  by saying it this way or having someone tell you to express your  thought this way .
32m,PAR,244073,246369,I don't wanna be apart of that .
32m,PAR,256682,260805,what was the first part ?
32m,PAR,265244,276434,&-um successful communication to me means +...
32m,PAR,276434,286068,&-um I've been apart of the Dallas chapter for a few years now .
32m,PAR,315942,320153,<and that's just a> [//] it's had the most profound affect on me in  that I talk to strangers who stutter <and I make them feel welcome>  [//] and I try to make them feel welcome .
32m,PAR,320153,328498,and because with each new stutterer that comes into our chapter  there's something within that person that resonates with me .
32m,PAR,342841,354325,so in turn I can express to him or her what I did to help battle  that .
32m,PAR,378042,381790,and the second part of that is we had a girl Personsname who came  to our chapter for eight [/] eight months &-uh last year and she  lives in Oklahoma .
32m,PAR,399900,402266,and &-um the fact that I spoke to her afterwards because what she  was doing she was stopping herself and stopping her sentences which  is something that I did .
32m,PAR,407536,416532,so I instantly knew what she was doing and could connect with her  on that .
32m,PAR,416532,428805,so after the group was over I gave her some advice on to go home  and read a book and to practice reading it out loud and to finish  your sentences that way when you finish a sentence you express your  thought or what you wanna get out is out and it's not trapped with  within you .
32m,PAR,447925,456179,and one experience that she has &-um that was almost a negative was  that she walked into a donut shop trying to order something and the  girl behind the counter was doing this .
32m,PAR,468143,480598,and instantly she wanted to walk out_of the store but she held her  composure and ordered what she wanted .
32m,PAR,480598,487524,and instantly she broke down in tears when she left the store .
32m,PAR,487524,495921,but when she was talking about this in the group &-um I said I'm  glad you stayed because you didn't let her win .
32m,PAR,510523,525983,&-um if I didn't stutter I don't think anything would be different  .
32m,PAR,525983,528763,&-um because I've had my own problems that I've dealt with personal  problems with talking to people .
32m,PAR,538577,540276,talking to girls especially .
32m,PAR,540276,547528,&-um that had nothing to do with my stutter .
32m,PAR,547528,555833,but if I didn't stutter I don't think anything would change in my  past experiences .
32m,PAR,566401,582114,that's kind of a tough question because every stutterer is  different and they react to specific questions differently .
32m,PAR,598553,602465,and I've been part of the Dallas chapter interview project for a  while where I have future speech language pathologists talk to me  &-um or interview me .
32m,PAR,602465,609144,&-um and its always the same ten questions and you can give advice  at the end .
32m,PAR,609144,614120,and my three biggest word of advice that I've said to students is  please be patient .
32m,PAR,616340,626581,because it's kind of cliche when you think about it when it comes  to stuttering or knowing someone who stutters .
32m,PAR,630494,635366,but it's not how they say it but what they hafta say that's  important .
32m,PAR,635366,639558,so you hafta think of it like [/] like that .
32m,PAR,639558,646077,and good eye contact is also very good .
32m,PAR,657134,670094,&-um the person you might be interviewing might not have very good  eye contact but that's because they're not useta being interviewed .
32m,PAR,687319,694638,but &-um the &-uh I don't know where I was going with that honestly  .
32m,PAR,694638,705013,&-um the person who might be getting interviewed might not be  giving good eye contact but they know when they talk to another  stutter or another person in a chapter meeting or at a conference  per se@c that good eye contact <good eye> [/] good eye contact is  something stutterers I think have .
32m,PAR,763441,766355,and that's what holds people's interests and [/] and keeping eye  contact with the person that's talking .
32m,INV,730168,742421,and they learn that by going to chapter meetings and learning about  stuttering and learning what people hafta say and it's what they say  that's important .
57m,PAR,14690,22058,great &-um well f:irst I &-um [/] I &-uh don't stutter nearly as  much as I useta .
57m,PAR,22058,24808,I &-um &-you_know had some good therapy and all of that .
57m,PAR,24808,33563,but as far as how it impacts me now I would say it impacts me in  regard to the idea that it's pretty much what I do .
57m,PAR,33563,39331,I mean so I guess in that regard it does impact so I'm working with  individuals who stutter all the time .
57m,PAR,39331,45409,and I'm doing research and &-you_know ↫t↫talking with people &-um  pretty consistently .
57m,PAR,45409,48658,<I don't> [//] it doesn't really impact me much as a therapist .
57m,PAR,48658,51309,I'm really able to be &+v as fluent as I wanna be .
57m,PAR,51309,57447,&-um can actually use the stuttering as a teaching tool for [/] for  those clients and for my students .
57m,PAR,57447,71773,now it does sometimes (.) occur more often ≠when I'm engaged with  &-you_know talking in faculty meetings or in ≠other kinds of things  but it doesn't really (.) impact me .
57m,PAR,71773,71973,I [/] I [/] I wouldn't say that .
57m,PAR,71973,72173,I pretty much say what I wanna say .
57m,PAR,72173,82257,and have pretty good &-um ability to deal with the s:tuttering and  handle it .
57m,PAR,82257,85991,it's not really a topic at my house besides related to my work .
57m,PAR,85991,86191,so my kids and my wife there's no issues .
57m,PAR,86191,90158,it doesn't impact anything .
57m,PAR,90158,90358,&-um and my extended family as well it's not such a big deal .
57m,PAR,90358,109273,sometimes when I'm (.) &-you_know out in the community doing new  things or meeting new people &-um introducing my↫s↫self it does  occur but I ↫g↫generally have good enough control over it that it's  not a problem .
57m,PAR,109273,111223,&-uhhuh .
57m,PAR,111223,111423,oh well &-um done a_lot_of reading in this area over the years .
57m,PAR,111423,147609,&-um it's most likely for most people &-um and again I [/] I say  most people (be)cause I don't think we have a full understanding in  regard to why the [/] the [/] the mechanism for an individual or for  the whole group but I think &-you_know we have a_lot_of research  that suggests it's (.) &-um that there's certainly a genetic  predisposition in most people and I think ≠more and more we're  ≠↫u↫understanding what that &-um genetic predisposition looks like .
57m,PAR,147609,163682,and then there's also a_lot_of evidence an:d I pretty much &-um  trust this ↫e↫evidence that there's some sort of neurological &-um  circuitry or breakdown that occurs &-um related to stuttering .
57m,PAR,163682,173323,so a_lot_of &-um the [//] when people stutter the brain &-you_know  is activated in a certain way that suggests an interference .
57m,PAR,173323,177566,and that leads to &-um the ↫ss↫speech disfluency that we see .
57m,PAR,177566,179838,and the stuttering like behaviors that we see .
57m,PAR,179838,185254,&-um and then I think from there there's a huge impact related to  learning .
57m,PAR,185254,185454,and to &-um just &-like living as a person who stutters that tends  to lead to the condition getting potentially worsened but certainly  more complex .
57m,PAR,185454,202256,and that's how I think people begin to learn ways to actually make  their stuttering more difficult strangely enough as they're trying  to help themselves .
57m,PAR,211674,217290,yeah well I think the therapy I received is very different than  what I actually do to help myself .
57m,PAR,217290,217490,I think I just might have knocked the mike down .
57m,PAR,217490,225658,&-um and what (.) I would say is I received a_lot_of treatment that  focused on fluency .
57m,PAR,225658,235007,and not that [/] that wasn't helpful I just don't think it really  &-um (.) was possible to maintain it to the level that people  expected or were [/] were treating .
57m,PAR,235007,251497,but I think what was also nice was the folks that I worked with  were very good at kinda changing gears and helping me learn to take  care of myself and work on kinda the cognitive behavioral emotional  aspects of my life that were just as much impact .
57m,PAR,251497,266672,and then I think (.) I learned a_lot_of things about being open and  disclosing and being [//] trying to approach stuttering in a more  positive way and approach speaking and people in a more positive way  and I think that was generally helpful .
57m,PAR,266672,275366,then &-you_know as I started to become more active in &-you_know  the stuttering community <as a> [/] ≠as a clinician .
57m,PAR,275366,284707,I also started to really practice and teach myself the things that  I was expected to teach clients which was <more the> [//] kinda the  model of easier stuttering .
57m,PAR,284707,289955,again continuing to be more &-ho &-um honest and open about  stuttering [//] voluntary stuttering .
57m,PAR,289955,297956,and I think that those kinds of things ↫k↫kinda as a self therapy  and as I was helping others really kinda predominate what I do .
57m,PAR,297956,311402,and &-um (.) and yeah &-you_know &-like I just think it was sort of  a culmination of not only a_lot_of &-um direct therapy but also  really my own self therapy that really made the difference .
57m,PAR,311402,313405,and I think the outcome's been pretty great .
57m,PAR,313405,317223,&-um and has allowed me to pretty much do whatever I wanna do .
57m,PAR,317223,318934,yeah .
57m,PAR,318934,327837,sure .
57m,PAR,327837,340005,&-um I think that &-um positive communication is essentially just  getting your point across whenever and wherever (.) you are and then  really wanting to be successful &-um .
57m,PAR,340005,340205,well [//] or being successful I think comes from just getting your  point across .
57m,PAR,340205,349573,it doesn't matter how fluent or disfluent it is or how stuttered or  [/] or nonstuttered it is .
57m,PAR,349573,355622,I think certainly f:luency helps because things are just easier but  it [/] it doesn't really mean it's better .
57m,PAR,355622,363519,for me a really good example of this was a couple months ago I  overreacted when I got an error message on my computer .
57m,PAR,363519,371536,and so I ≠went through these steps and I downloaded (.)  ≠unnecessary and potentially harmful &-um software .
57m,PAR,371536,371736,&-um ↫i↫it was a [//] ↫k↫kind of an antivirus .
57m,PAR,371736,383096,and as I was talking it through with the person who was guiding me  and doing this I'm like this probably is unnecessary but I'm gonna  do it .
57m,PAR,383096,385423,then when I got done I'm like wait a second what just happened .
57m,PAR,385423,385623,and kind of as I ↫c↫came to my senses .
57m,PAR,385623,391455,so I got back on the phone the next day .
57m,PAR,391455,402655,and it was like an hour of just sitting there telling these folks  who I think were kind of [//] ≠it was a phishing@c scam by this  company clearly .
57m,PAR,402655,419103,and I just stayed on the phone and kept saying you will refund this  money now or else you're going to hafta be dealing with <↫th-th↫the  federal government &-like agency I'm blanking on the name right now  that will [//] oh> [//] the ≠f@l c@l [/] c@l will be dealing with  this .
57m,PAR,419103,422815,and you will hafta deal with my bank and you will hafta deal with  my credit card company .
57m,PAR,422815,423015,and they kept trying to <put me off> [/] put me off &-like <make  better offers> [/] make better offers and I really thought that was  great .
57m,PAR,423015,436304,and I was [//] ↫m↫most likely stuttered a bit ↫d↫doing it but I  thought that was really great (be)cause I just kept at it and I  didn't back down .
57m,PAR,436304,436504,and I think that [/] that was a good communication experience  (be)cause I also didn't get mad and go over the top .
57m,PAR,436504,442252,I just kept them involved .
57m,PAR,442252,449640,<in ↫th↫the> [/] in [/] in the communication even though they [//]  <the or> [/] <the or> [//] ↫i↫in the discussion even though they  clearly didn't wanna be having it .
57m,PAR,449640,451417,and I thought that was really positive .
57m,PAR,451417,460051,and at that point it didn't really matter that I stuttered or not  (be)cause I was &-um again saying what I wanted to say communicating  it in the way I wanted to say it .
57m,PAR,460051,461717,and then there was a positive outcome .
57m,PAR,461717,463821,okay .
57m,PAR,463821,463901,thanks .
57m,PAR,467951,469653,yeah I really think a_lot_of things .
57m,PAR,469653,472060,I would not be a speech language pathologist .
57m,PAR,472060,476752,I would not be a &+prof well I [/] I might be a professor but I  have no idea what that would be in .
57m,PAR,476752,503934,&-um <so I think that> [//] (.) <a good friend of mine one time  said that &-you_know what's really cool about> [//] (.) <and it came  out_of nowhere we ↫w-w↫weren't even talking about stuttering per_se  we were just talking about &-like> [//] ↫w↫we hadn't seen each_other  in a long time ↫t↫this was a friend from high school and <he kinda  said> [//] he goes &-you_know it seems like you having to deal with  this and he said this he didn't say stuttering but he said you  having to deal with this r:eally gave you a purpose that a_lot_of  other people don't get .
57m,PAR,503934,513403,and I guess I had thought about it that way but you don't always  (.) &-you_know ↫y↫your acquaintances and your friends you don't  really always say those kinds of things to each_other .
57m,PAR,513403,515338,I think especially perhaps men .
57m,PAR,515338,525816,I'm not sure but it was just really interesting to have someone say  it like that who (.) I hadn't seen in a very long time but I had  known very well when I was young and for [//] ↫w-w↫when I was having  a_lot_of trouble .
57m,PAR,525816,526016,and I think that [/] that kinda sums it up is I think that I really  have no clue what I would be doing .
57m,PAR,526016,538003,it would probably not be anything as (.) interesting or as  purposeful as ≠what I've done .
57m,PAR,538003,560420,I spose [: suppose] is kind of it so I (.) guess in the end I think  it's really corny to say that s:tuttering is necessarily a blessing  (be)cause I don't ↫r↫really think that way about much of anything  but I think that (.) that's really something that when I look at  other people (be)cause I didn't [/] ↫d↫didn't create this notion of  people <who stuttering> [//] who [/] who stutter becoming stuttering  specialists or anything .
57m,PAR,560420,566836,<that wasn't my like> [//] I didn't wake up one morning I learned  from a_lot_of other people that that's possible .
57m,PAR,566836,567036,and I think that [/] that ≠notion in that way &+i has turned out to  be a positive .
57m,PAR,567036,580527,and I think having those role models of other people who had taken  that path has been really great for s:omeone like me .
57m,PAR,580527,586175,is that &-you_know you saw that you saw it as a possibility and  then I was able ↫t-t↫to achieve it so .
57m,PAR,586175,586375,xxx so I can't really answer that .
57m,PAR,586375,591001,I have no clue what I would be doing .
57m,PAR,591001,591081,yeah .
57m,PAR,598936,606816,well I [/] I [/] I [/] I think that a big thing I'd like to say to  students is don't (.) give up on this area of study .
57m,PAR,606816,627519,I think a_lot_of times &-um ≠↫u-u↫unless you're in a institution or  department or clinic that allows for opportunity people give up on  it because you're going to be seeing lots_of other kinds of folks  who have very serious problems as well &-you_know with communication  or with swallowing that you're probably going to get more  opportunity to work with those people .
57m,PAR,627519,630382,just because perhaps the clinics serve more of them .
57m,PAR,630382,646550,but I think it's really something that if you get turned on to it  and if you really buy into it you can not only carve out a really  important niche for yourself and your career but I think even more  so you can really benefit because working with people who stutter is  [/] is very interesting .
57m,PAR,646550,650949,I think you can have a very large impact on a person's life .
57m,PAR,650949,653745,and then I think there's also really great things you can do with  it &-um &-you_know from there .
57m,PAR,653745,653945,and it's such a need in our field .
57m,PAR,653945,660515,and I think it's such a need (.) in the world .
57m,PAR,660515,672286,so I think it's just such an ↫e↫enriching area that if you  ≠continue to foster that &-you_know if you have a spark of a &-like  interest I think there's so many great things that can be done .
57m,PAR,672286,673900,so I hope students will do that .
57m,PAR,673900,682282,I also think ≠one of the number one things you ought@c to do if  you're interested in stuttering is actually meet a person who  stutters and ask (th)em out for coffee .
57m,PAR,682282,686251,(be)cause I think you can really learn a lot just being around  people socially .
57m,PAR,686251,689667,and I mean not every person who stutters is a member of a clinical  population .
57m,PAR,689667,694450,and I think a lot can be learned by just being around people who  stutter .
57m,PAR,694450,711582,so I think if it's an interest attend conferences &-↫u↫um reach out  to local organizations that might be &-um ≠involved in stuttering  like the n@l s@l a@l chapter if there is a chapter in your community  and just ask if you can come and attend just so you can really learn  a lot .
57m,PAR,711582,711782,and I think there's a lot to be gained by that sort of  experiential@c or self learning .
57m,INV,0,14690,alright so please talk about the impact of stuttering on your daily  life you can talk about your interactions with family and friends  school or work and your participation in community activities .
57m,INV,14690,14770,great .
57m,INV,14770,14970,what do you think causes stuttering ?
57m,INV,202256,211674,if you have received treatment for your stuttering which you  mentioned you have tell me about your therapy experiences and the  outcomes of these therapies .
57m,INV,211674,211874,please describe what successful communication means to you and can  you give an example of a positive communicative experience ?
57m,INV,211874,212074,that's a great example .
57m,INV,463821,467951,if you didn't stutter what might be different in your life ?
57m,INV,591001,598936,what else would you wanna say to students or the general public to  help them learn about stuttering or ways to support people who  stutter ?
57m,INV,711582,718718,that's great .
46ma,PAR,5586,9998,stuttering has impacted everything that I do in my life .
46ma,PAR,9998,14726,<it &-um> [//] I get up in the morning I don't think about it it's  just there .
46ma,PAR,14884,19932,&-uh anytime I opened my mouth which is going to be thousands of  time a day it's there .
46ma,PAR,19932,29840,&-um so it impacts it on that level but it also impacts me really  in social situations both on the job and off the job .
46ma,PAR,29840,35473,&-um &-uh I still struggle with how to respond to people who see me  stutter .
46ma,PAR,35473,41940,and with the things that they tell me and the things that they show  me through their nonverbal communication .
46ma,PAR,41940,43360,that's a challenge .
46ma,PAR,43360,50012,now being married my wife struggles with that because she doesn't  know how to respond .
46ma,PAR,50012,53118,yes she knows about helping me having to advertise my stutter .
46ma,PAR,53118,58901,but she can see the pained look on someone else's face and she  knows what's going through their head .
46ma,PAR,58901,60422,what's wrong with this guy ?
46ma,PAR,60422,62927,&-uh is he okay ?
46ma,PAR,62927,65134,and for her she is having to learn .
46ma,PAR,65134,70934,so how has it impacted my life my goodness &-uh how has it not  impacted my life .
46ma,PAR,70934,82164,<everything about my life has> [//] everything that I have done in  my life has been impacted by how I talk .
46ma,PAR,90119,95399,you know back when I was around twenty three or so my stuttering  was damn good really good .
46ma,PAR,95399,99577,&-uh so good that &-uh I was not able to get a job .
46ma,PAR,99577,100796,it was very difficult .
46ma,PAR,100796,101899,job interviews were tough .
46ma,PAR,101899,103789,doors were just closing left and right .
46ma,PAR,103789,108586,and my parents because I was back at home (be)cause I didn't have a  real paying job .
46ma,PAR,108586,115019,so I was back at home they said they were gonna give me this  opportunity to go to an intensive therapy program .
46ma,PAR,115019,117860,and I turned it down .
46ma,PAR,117860,125964,I said no mom dad I don't wanna do that and I basically said I  cannot imagine my life without my stutter .
46ma,PAR,125964,128253,my stutter was always been there .
46ma,PAR,128253,133015,my stutter was there when my friends left me in high school .
46ma,PAR,133015,137679,I wasn't very social who was there my stutter was there .
46ma,PAR,137679,142740,my stutter was there in college when I hadta fight my way through  presentations in class .
46ma,PAR,142740,146416,when I hadta fight my way through social situations .
46ma,PAR,146416,149591,my stutter was there my stutter was always there .
46ma,PAR,149591,151764,I don't want my stutter not by my side .
46ma,PAR,151764,152834,absolutely not .
46ma,PAR,152834,154138,it's not on my back .
46ma,PAR,154138,155926,it's not weighing me down .
46ma,PAR,155926,157329,it's on my hip .
46ma,PAR,157329,157997,it's on my side .
46ma,PAR,157997,160203,I don't wanna live life without being a stutterer .
46ma,PAR,165616,166819,yeah &-um .
46ma,PAR,172185,174459,speech therapy .
46ma,PAR,174459,176813,I have been in speech therapy prior to kindergarten .
46ma,PAR,176813,184084,and I was in speech therapy first for my r@l my th@o my s@l my w@l  that types stuff .
46ma,PAR,184084,191105,once we were able to kind of get those to sound correctly they  started to work on my stuttering .
46ma,PAR,191105,193994,and I was in up until like age eighteen .
46ma,PAR,193994,201395,<and I was a &-uh> [//] I equate my going to therapy like some  people going to church .
46ma,PAR,201395,203136,you go to church .
46ma,PAR,203136,204053,you sit .
46ma,PAR,204053,205423,you don't really participate .
46ma,PAR,205423,206276,you aren't engaged .
46ma,PAR,206276,208750,it goes in one ear out the other ear .
46ma,PAR,208750,213193,I would cheat on all of my assignments that are sposta do .
46ma,PAR,213193,214816,I sposta talk to ten people .
46ma,PAR,214816,217006,sposta track how my fluency was .
46ma,PAR,217006,218577,I would cheat .
46ma,PAR,218577,222103,I would write down those instances on a piece of paper just turn it  in .
46ma,PAR,222103,228619,but yes they taught me some of the basic techniques of easy onsets  .
46ma,PAR,228619,231176,I'm not sure they called that back in the seventies back in the  eighties .
46ma,PAR,231176,232229,but that's it .
46ma,PAR,232229,236175,&-uh also their idea of kind of slowing down a little bit .
46ma,PAR,236175,243893,I remember some of my therapy was I would be talking like this  [=! slow rate] .
46ma,PAR,243893,244093,when I put my finger down I could speak at a normal rate until I  raise my finger up .
46ma,PAR,252014,257130,that's the one shaping exercise that I think had the biggest impact  on my life .
46ma,PAR,257130,262811,(be)cause what that did do was it taught me to clearly enunciate my  words .
46ma,PAR,262811,267406,and today actually I get paid to talk at conferences .
46ma,PAR,267406,268143,it's sick .
46ma,PAR,268143,273122,but what I you do is I try to clearly enunciate every single word  that I say .
46ma,PAR,273122,280357,I talk in a louder voice and I think that has some sort of a choral  effect type of a deal to where I kind of hear myself talking .
46ma,PAR,280357,283917,and I maintain a confident presence .
46ma,PAR,283917,290017,and I feel as though if I can maintain this <confidence> [//]  confidant presence my speech is usually better .
46ma,PAR,293994,303552,the things that cause stuttering from what I've heard and read are  probably through genetics .
46ma,PAR,303552,304941,my dad stuttered .
46ma,PAR,304941,307146,&-uh he doesn't now really .
46ma,PAR,307146,309585,my brother is a covert stutterer .
46ma,PAR,309585,310671,it's as simple as that .
46ma,PAR,310671,315100,he is the most competitive person I've ever met in my life and he  fights everyday past his stutter .
46ma,PAR,315100,317021,and I give the guy credit galore .
46ma,PAR,321817,325178,yeah a covert stutterer is someone who hides their stutter .
46ma,PAR,325178,331727,is someone who hides their stutter by doing certain things such as  changing a word .
46ma,PAR,331727,339733,so for instance if I am to say I'm [/] I'm stuttering on Greenville  I might change it to say oh I live in Dallas .
46ma,PAR,339733,341671,(be)cause Dallas is easier to say .
46ma,PAR,341671,346768,covert stutterer is also someone who doesn't put themselves in  positions to talk .
46ma,PAR,346768,349058,they find ways not to talk .
46ma,PAR,349058,354590,and the times that they do get put on the spot to talk they may  fake as though they don't know the answer .
46ma,PAR,354590,354790,when the reality is they do know the answer .
46ma,PAR,354790,360773,so those are some instances where someone is a covert stutterer .
46ma,PAR,360773,367691,&-uh but my brother I think had practiced a_lot_of that and it's  just now he's learned to word swap .
46ma,PAR,367691,373038,and I think that's his biggest tool is just changing out those  words that he knows he's going to have a block on .
46ma,PAR,389733,401597,for a young stutterer the message that I would give them is  something that I wish I had done as a teenager .
46ma,PAR,401597,402719,as a child .
46ma,PAR,402719,404807,find another person who stutters .
46ma,PAR,404807,407513,who is the same age that you are .
46ma,PAR,407513,409535,form a friendship .
46ma,PAR,409535,410489,form a bond .
46ma,PAR,410489,416538,because together you're going to be able to have someone to share  your feelings with .
46ma,PAR,416538,416738,and you are not going to be alone .
46ma,PAR,416738,420615,I know the whole line of you are not alone .
46ma,PAR,420615,423089,but seek out someone who does stutter .
46ma,PAR,423089,423289,I regret to this day in high school .
46ma,PAR,423289,428636,there was someone else in high school that stuttered .
46ma,PAR,428636,434102,I failed to forge a relationship with him .
46ma,PAR,434102,436208,to this day I regret that decision .
46ma,PAR,436208,437494,regret it .
46ma,PAR,437494,437694,we could have become much stronger .
46ma,PAR,437694,449591,and who knows I might have been able to have reached a better place  with how I talk if I had someone to talk with who was experiencing  the same things that I was .
46ma,PAR,449591,449791,to this day I regret that .
46ma,PAR,449791,456844,so the best advice meet other people who stutter who are your age  and form a friendship .
46ma,PAR,456844,457044,training to be therapists .
46ma,PAR,459419,468193,one of the things that I'm really loving seeing is so many more  people who do stutter becoming speech language pathologists .
46ma,PAR,468193,471033,I think that is just phenomenal .
46ma,PAR,471033,480509,because me as a child having someone else who has the same sort of  challenges I have I would have listened to them I would not have  cheated on my assignments .
46ma,PAR,480509,484151,had the speech language pathologists been someone who stuttered .
46ma,PAR,484151,485138,no not at all .
46ma,PAR,485138,488997,but for the person who doesn't stutter who goes in this field .
46ma,PAR,488997,495933,I just want you to know that you have a major role to play .
46ma,PAR,495933,498473,you can impact so many people's lives .
46ma,PAR,498473,505209,and I commend you for having the compassion to be able to help  people .
46ma,PAR,505209,513129,because <you> [//] the impact that a speech language pathologist  can make on a stutterer is huge but also on the parents of a  stutterer .
46ma,PAR,513129,513329,and I think that's something else to where &-uh the parents needta  also have some people to talk to .
46ma,PAR,513329,526599,and if a speech language pathologist can also can help the parents  to better understand it I think that's all the better .
46ma,INV,0,5586,so &-um could you talk a little bit about the impact of stuttering  on your everyday life ?
46ma,INV,82164,86676,well there is this other question further down which seems  appropriate now .
46ma,INV,86676,90119,if you didn't stutter how would your life be different ?
46ma,INV,160203,165616,&-um now you have received treatment for your stuttering at some  point haven't you ?
46ma,INV,166819,172185,can you talk a little bit about <the sort of the> [//] those things  that seem to help and those things that didn't seem to help at all ?
46ma,INV,290017,292657,okay .
46ma,INV,292657,293994,do you have any ideas about what you think causes stuttering ?
46ma,INV,317021,321817,can you define covert stuttering just in_case whoever sees this  video doesn't already know it ?
46ma,INV,321817,322017,okay &-um you actually went through a_lot_of topics pretty quickly  .
46ma,INV,322017,322217,there is one important question that we're asking everybody .
46ma,INV,322217,322417,what would you wanna say to students or to other people who really  don't have much experience with stuttering ?
46ma,INV,373038,389733,what kind of message would you give them ?
46ma,INV,456844,459419,any advice for the people training to be therapists ?
46ma,INV,526599,530041,<thank you> [/] thank you very [/] very much .
29ma,PAR,27079,45945,I would say that more than most people stuttering impacts my daily  life in that I'm a speech pathologist because I stutter and I'm  getting my p@l h@l d@l in speech pathology so I can study stuttering  .
29ma,PAR,45945,50893,and &-um I'm constantly thinking about stuttering and talking .
29ma,PAR,50893,53348,about stuttering .
29ma,PAR,53348,58864,I also run a self help group in Memphis for people who stutter .
29ma,PAR,58864,74921,there's lots_of people in Memphis who stutter so for better or for  worse stuttering has taken up an inordinate amount of my life and my  time but I guess that's thinking of stuttering abstractly .
29ma,PAR,74921,78734,in terms of thinking about my own stuttering .
29ma,PAR,78734,82644,I hafta say I think about it much less than I useta .
29ma,PAR,82644,85857,I useta think about it everytime I opened my mouth .
29ma,PAR,85857,93893,every word I said at it's peak almost every single word I said had  a little bit of stuttering in it .
29ma,PAR,93893,105849,<and now I still have> [//] it still fluctuates I still have good  days and bad days .
29ma,PAR,105849,115307,where I'm still trying not to stutter and still avoiding and on  those days I would say I still think about stuttering quite often .
29ma,PAR,115307,118250,that I think about not wanting to stutter .
29ma,PAR,118250,123687,on most days I think I'm comfortable about letting stuttering  happen .
29ma,PAR,123687,135033,and &-um even using stuttering to &-um connect better with people .
29ma,PAR,135033,143556,I've often had the experience of after hearing me stutter people  sharing experiences with me .
29ma,PAR,143556,153314,seemingly unrelated to stuttering whether it's depression or  psychological issues or other issues .
29ma,PAR,153314,163410,fears and other emotional things and so often I feel that my  stuttering acts as a way of connecting with people more .
29ma,PAR,163410,173720,in that way &-um I do think about when I'm speaking to stutter as  openly as possible .
29ma,PAR,173720,176884,getting that sort of intimacy in conversation .
29ma,PAR,176884,183075,&-um but I think about it much less than when I useta when I was  still struggling with it .
29ma,PAR,183075,186720,&-uh yeah .
29ma,PAR,190916,198737,&-um <I think lots_of> [//] I guess the cause the actual physical  mechanism that creates a disfluency .
29ma,PAR,198737,206110,that most of the research is suggesting it has &-uh genetic origins  .
29ma,PAR,206110,208968,you have a genetic predisposition to stutter .
29ma,PAR,208968,224122,and then depending on how you develop I would imagine in the womb  and then through childhood those genes can be expressed more or less  to an extent .
29ma,PAR,224122,232265,your neurophysiology and anatomy develop .
29ma,PAR,232265,240447,seems to reinforce stuttering or help it to resolve on it's own .
29ma,PAR,240447,248721,it seems that through childhood we develop patterns of speaking .
29ma,PAR,248721,252030,those patterns of speaking get coded in our brains .
29ma,PAR,252030,255405,through neural connections and pathways .
29ma,PAR,255405,265218,we can reinforce stuttered way of speaking through our &-um I don't  wanna say .
29ma,PAR,265218,271579,bad habits because I don't think it's a good or bad thing it's just  something that happens automatically but .
29ma,PAR,271579,278830,if the stuttering doesn't resolve in early childhood and you start  to develop reactions to it .
29ma,PAR,278830,289446,reactions help to reinforce the stuttering and it continues to  become a bit and harder to &-uh .
29ma,PAR,289446,291816,not react to .
29ma,PAR,291816,301144,and so what I think most of you would call stuttering is those deep  seated neurological connections that you built .
29ma,PAR,301144,311443,in childhood which is why I think therapy is so hard because not  only are you changing your reactions but your reactions .
29ma,PAR,311443,320512,all of neuro correlates and you're reprogramming your brain a bit  as you get more comfortable .
29ma,PAR,320512,326110,&-um but also I think the experience of stuttering happens within a  social context and .
29ma,PAR,326110,331529,our context is one where stuttering is devalued and there is a  stigma around stuttering and .
29ma,PAR,331529,337862,disability and I think that contributes to the reactions that we  have .
29ma,PAR,337862,348575,and I would imagine people stuttering would look drastically  different in a society that accepted it completely like if .
29ma,PAR,348575,355070,if the world was like the n@l s@l a@l stuttering would sound and  look different &-uh .
29ma,PAR,355070,364779,I don't think the way we speak is directly written in our genes or  in our brains I think it always interacts with where we are living .
29ma,PAR,378528,382571,I had speech therapy when I was really young for .
29ma,PAR,382571,389746,it started for my articulation I think I had a_lot_of speech sound  errors .
29ma,PAR,389746,394662,I remember while I was in therapy for articulation I developed my  stuttering .
29ma,PAR,394662,408261,and I don't remember much speech therapy targeting my stuttering I  remember mostly about articulation like practicing saying certain  sounds and working up to saying it in sentences .
29ma,PAR,408261,414474,&-um I don't remember that was private therapy but I think I also  had therapy in school .
29ma,PAR,414474,422127,that I remember being tested I remember diagnostics but I don't  remember the therapy itself .
29ma,PAR,422127,425669,and that went up until fifth grade .
29ma,PAR,425669,438889,we moved from the urban part of where I lived to the more suburban  to the town of Picipsy when I was in middle school when I was in  sixth grade .
29ma,PAR,438889,444130,I told my parents I was tired of speech therapy I didn't wanna do  it anymore .
29ma,PAR,444130,449166,and then didn't receive therapy again until high school .
29ma,PAR,449166,459143,and that was because my speech had progressively gotten much [/]  much more effortful and I was stuttering very [/] very severely .
29ma,PAR,459143,465177,and sort of reached the rock bottom .
29ma,PAR,465177,476875,and what had happened was I think my grandmother saw something  about Speech_Easy on television maybe like Good_Morning_America or  Oprah or something .
29ma,PAR,476875,482508,and called up my mom or cut out a newspaper article or something .
29ma,PAR,482508,492164,anyway my parents approached me about this thing and I was sort of  offended and against it I didn't wanna talk about my stuttering or  deal with it .
29ma,PAR,492164,499116,but I think the fact that my grandma cut out the clip made me  realize that maybe it was a bigger problem than I thought .
29ma,PAR,499116,506637,so we went down to New_York_City to talk to with a distributor a  Speech_Easy distributor he was either an audiologist or speech  pathologist .
29ma,PAR,506637,515310,and he said that in_order_to use a Speech_Easy you should also be  receiving therapy that you get the most out_of it when you work with  a therapist .
29ma,PAR,515310,520757,so we got the Speech_Easy and I also started therapy again in high  school .
29ma,PAR,520757,525284,with a speech pathologist who specialized in stuttering .
29ma,PAR,525284,532255,and I saw her for about a year and a half and that was a good  experience .
29ma,PAR,532255,542581,<we> [//] I would say half the therapy was fluency type stuff and  half of it was attitudinal and sort of changing my perceptions of  stuttering and facing my fears .
29ma,PAR,542581,551462,the fluency stuff I don't think it did much I don't remember being  able to use any of it in real life or it changing anything .
29ma,PAR,551462,554778,but the attitudinal stuff really pushed me .
29ma,PAR,554778,564107,to start seeing my life stutterer instead of really seeing it as  only being able to be lived unless I was fluent .
29ma,PAR,564107,569480,she would make me call up places on the phone and fake stutter .
29ma,PAR,569480,572927,and show me videos of <adults> [//] successful adults stuttering .
29ma,PAR,572927,576289,&-uh I think that really helped me to cope with it .
29ma,PAR,576289,585914,&-um and that was the last time I received therapy I left there  still stuttering quite severely but with a changed attitude .
29ma,PAR,585914,590492,<and> [//] but I would say the biggest changes in my speech  happened in grad school .
29ma,PAR,590492,593628,&-um where it was a_lot_of self therapy I guess .
29ma,PAR,593628,600754,because &-uh my initial clinical experiences were really hard and I  &-uh could barely speak to my clients .
29ma,PAR,600754,605156,and &-uh my clinical supervisors were freaking out and didn't know  what to do with me .
29ma,PAR,605156,609427,and I was freaking out I thought I was going to hafta drop out_of  the program .
29ma,PAR,609427,623335,and just sort of I think that was the first time I needed to work  on my speech where it had consequences so_that really forced me to  apply a_lot_of the things I had learned over the years .
29ma,PAR,623335,633743,&-um through the n@l s@l a@l through taking stuttering classes in  grad school I had gone down to visit Vivian and her philosophy was  in my mind a lot .
29ma,PAR,633743,640173,so I would say the biggest changes happened from grad school until  the present which has been a_lot_of self therapy .
29ma,PAR,660931,665109,I think successful communication is when .
29ma,PAR,665109,674619,you are able to express what you wanna say when you wanna say it in  a way that the listener receives that message .
29ma,PAR,674619,683849,and you can both in a back and forth fashion so the person you're  speaking to can also express what they wanna say when they wanna say  it .
29ma,PAR,683849,687849,that interaction should be enjoyable .
29ma,PAR,687849,707756,&-um I'm not sure that has anything to do with stuttering or not I  actually think that stuttering can help enhance successful  communication in that a_lot_of our communication is automatic you  sort of get into communicative routines where there is a rhythm to  how we speak .
29ma,PAR,707756,714879,and not really saying much other than trite phrases like hi how are  you I'm good .
29ma,PAR,714879,722429,but stuttering sort of breaks up all of those patterns and forces  people to communicate with each_other outside of those routines .
29ma,PAR,722429,731388,and I think that makes communication more successful because it's  not bound by heuristics .
29ma,PAR,731388,736758,a recent communicative exchange that was successful was .
29ma,PAR,736758,740445,I just interviewed somebody for Stutter_Talk podcast .
29ma,PAR,740445,744207,&-um she was a young woman from China .
29ma,PAR,744207,751456,and &-uh we had a great conversation about her she was a young  woman who stutters from China we had a great conversation about her  upbringing in China .
29ma,PAR,751456,754515,and differently stuttering was viewed .
29ma,PAR,754515,757953,dramatically differently from the United_States .
29ma,PAR,757953,762586,and &-uh we laughed a lot and I learned a lot and it was a_lot_of  fun .
29ma,PAR,770295,777308,most everything I suppose because like I was saying earlier my  whole career is around stuttering .
29ma,PAR,777308,781402,and a_lot_of my friends I met through stuttering .
29ma,PAR,781402,788000,my girlfriend I met in Memphis because I was going to school for  stuttering in Memphis .
29ma,PAR,788000,800804,and on a soccer team for speech pathologists in grad school and I  can't think of most I can't think anything in my life that would  have not been affected by stuttering .
29ma,PAR,800804,817031,it's almost such a big part of my life that it's hard for me to  think about what I would be like because it wouldn't even be me it  almost seems absurd to answer I think just about everything would be  different .
29ma,PAR,837955,845291,&-um I would say that the best way to learn about stuttering is to  talk to a person who stutters .
29ma,PAR,845291,853780,and that I think what speech therapists especially needta bear in  mind when they're working with people who stutter .
29ma,PAR,853780,861367,is that the stutter itself is not the problem it's the effort spent  in wrestling with the stutter .
29ma,PAR,861367,864811,and I think it's possible to stutter without effort .
29ma,PAR,864811,878814,if you are able to stutter without anticipating the stutter and  then reacting the stutter and then thinking about the stutter  there's like three moments where the stutter can be disruptive .
29ma,PAR,878814,885333,but I think the stutter can happen without anticipation without  reaction and without &-uh rumination .
29ma,PAR,885333,894609,<&-um and so it's> [//] I think the stutter can be left alone and  you can concentrate on those other things .
29ma,PAR,894609,910588,and from my experience most of the people who I have talked to who  have successfully navigated their stuttering that's been how they've  done it by let themselves stutter without reacting to it .
29ma,PAR,910588,914591,&-um and yeah I guess that's it .
29ma,INV,199,27079,you can talk about your interactions with family friends school and  or work and your participation in community events .
29ma,INV,186720,190916,what do you think causes stuttering ?
29ma,INV,364779,378528,if you have received treatment for your stuttering tell me about  your therapy experiences and the outcomes of these therapies .
29ma,INV,640173,660931,please describe what successful communication means to you and can  you give an example of a positive communicative experience ?
29ma,INV,762586,770295,if you didn't stutter what might be different in your life ?
29ma,INV,817031,837955,and what else would you wanna say to students or the general public  to help them learn about stuttering or ways to support people who  stutter ?
26m,PAR,29295,37513,stuttering has been an impact mostly in work and in school for me  not so much in the social setting .
26m,PAR,37513,44607,with my friends I'm not really too concerned about whether I  stutter and how I [/] I sound .
26m,PAR,44607,49424,but it definitely does impact in my class with raising my hand I'm  a .
26m,PAR,49424,53326,a physical therapy graduate student at the University of Maryland  Baltimore .
26m,PAR,53326,55123,and &-um .
26m,PAR,55123,57108,I [/] I feel .
26m,PAR,57108,61191,self conscious to raise my hand sometimes and participate in class  and .
26m,PAR,61191,70650,&-uh going out into clinical rotations my blocks are exacerbated so  that's where stuttering has the most life impact on me is in work  and in school .
26m,PAR,79549,85687,from what I've heard stuttering is caused by a neurochemical  disorder related to dopamine in the brain .
26m,PAR,100161,105675,I had speech therapy in grade school .
26m,PAR,105675,111606,and even early intervention as well from when I was three years old  to I was sixteen when I was discharged in high school .
26m,PAR,111606,118409,and the outcomes of those therapies wasn't consistent or effective  .
26m,PAR,118409,123395,in decreasing the .
26m,PAR,123395,144207,the impact that stuttering has on my life but avoidance reduction  therapy in the last four years has had a tremendous impact on my  life where now I enjoy communicating with people and I'm very [/]  very open and my natural personality shows because I think that  organically I'm a very extroverted person but I was being held back  by my stutter .
26m,PAR,144207,150273,so I've had tremendous outcomes through avoidance reduction therapy  .
26m,PAR,169103,170346,sure .
26m,PAR,170346,182312,so successful communication to me means that other people  understand you and you're able to convey your messages in a way  that's enjoyable for both parties .
26m,PAR,182312,207628,so &-uh a really positive experience that I had recently was where  I gave a keynote speech &-um at a nonprofit organization it was a  fundraiser gala and I'm a graduate of the program and there I was  speaking to over two hundred and fifty wealthy individuals who were  looking to support our cause and I gave about an eight minute speech  in front of these people .
26m,PAR,207628,216092,and it was extremely nerve wracking but I enjoy it tremendously and  I received really great feedback from it afterwards and .
26m,PAR,216092,228314,and it has motivated me to continue pursuing public speaking and to  not shy away from that because it is important to be able to do that  once I become a physical therapist .
26m,PAR,240662,253227,probably wouldn't have the great friends that I do now &-uh I think  that it has helped me to meet a_lot_of people who I wouldn't have  ordinarily met and I think that I would have followed a different  path in my life because .
26m,PAR,253227,262086,where I grew up I was around a_lot_of uneducated individuals low  socioeconomic status and I think it actually helped me in the long  run .
26m,PAR,262086,281343,not fitting in socially &-um I let my stutter hold me back so I  never participated in activities and so I think it actually really  helped me in the long run because I ended up associating more with  older individuals people who were wiser like I would always talk  more with the parents than my actualy peers .
26m,PAR,281343,292462,and so I am really glad that I do stutter because if I didn't I  don't know where I would be but I do think I'm in a good place now  and I think I have a bright future .
26m,PAR,315580,324595,I think there are some common misconceptions about stuttering and  one is that it's caused by nerves it's not caused by nerves but it  can be exacerbated by nerves .
26m,PAR,324595,330392,so I know that when I'm tired or nervous I stutter with more  severity or more frequently .
26m,PAR,330392,334380,and so .
26m,PAR,334380,344970,that's something that I would tell other people it's a common  question that I get and also it would be nice to educate people that  everyone stutters and it's really on a continuum .
26m,PAR,344970,349131,and to answer the second part of the question could you repeat it  again ?
26m,PAR,363029,371843,oh yeah so to support people who stutter be a really good listener  be patient don't fill in their sentences .
26m,PAR,371843,379048,or their words (be)cause often times you'll guess wrong and then  it'll take even longer to communicate the message .
26m,PAR,379048,387058,so &-uh be patient and [/] and that's the best thing you can do for  someone who stutters .
26m,PAR,388558,390822,yep .
26m,INV,0,15577,please talk about the impact of stuttering on your daily life .
26m,INV,15577,24097,you can talk about your interactions with family and friends school  and or work .
26m,INV,24097,29295,and your participation in community activities .
26m,INV,70650,79549,what do you think causes stuttering ?
26m,INV,85687,97374,if you have received treatment for your stuttering tell me about  your therapy experiences .
26m,INV,97374,100161,and the outcomes of these therapies .
26m,INV,150273,162556,please describe what successful communication means to you .
26m,INV,162556,169103,can you give an example of a positive communicative experience ?
26m,INV,228314,240662,if you didn't stutter what might be different in your life ?
26m,INV,292462,310433,what else would you wanna say to students or the general public to  help them learn about stuttering ?
26m,INV,310433,315580,or ways to support people who stutter ?
26m,INV,349131,363029,how do you think or is there anything you'd wanna say to students  or the general public about how they can support people who stutter  ?
26m,INV,387058,388558,alright thank you .
62f,PAR,13905,15992,right .
62f,PAR,16736,32264,&-um stuttering useta have a big impact on [//] I was filled with  shame and fear .
62f,PAR,32264,37194,and when I found the &-um n@l s@l p@l back in nineteen ninety eight  everything changed .
62f,PAR,37194,43763,and I became an s@l l@l p@l .
62f,PAR,43763,48704,and it was a life changing experience for me .
62f,PAR,59483,70743,well I worked in research science because that was something where  I wouldn't hafta talk to people .
62f,PAR,70743,73450,and I did that for over twenty years .
62f,PAR,73450,85485,and I gotta the point where I was around forty years old and I  couldn't imaging myself still doing that at age fifty .
62f,PAR,85485,89491,so I made a career change .
62f,PAR,102173,106712,yeah I didn't have treatment until I was forty years old .
62f,PAR,106712,116529,and &-um I had gone to the &-um Hollins_Institute .
62f,PAR,116529,120494,I did very well while I was there when I got home I couldn't talk .
62f,PAR,120494,131573,then I went into stuttering modification therapy which changed  everything .
62f,PAR,131573,134692,that was wonderful .
62f,PAR,134692,136701,yeah .
62f,PAR,144315,154567,&-um just being able to say what you wanna say regardless if you  stutter or not .
62f,PAR,159815,166732,you know I think about that and I really don't know .
62f,PAR,166732,183030,&-um you know I never wanted a career &-um all I ever wanted to do  was to be a housewife .
62f,PAR,183030,191940,but instead I never gotta do that and I have spent my life working  .
62f,PAR,191940,195497,so I don't really know how it would be different .
62f,PAR,205499,222111,I think it's a neurological &-um difference that some people are  born with and then environmental factors either bring it out or  don't bring it out .
62f,PAR,235221,243900,&-um give your clients the message that it's okay to stutter .
62f,PAR,243900,254571,teach them all the tools &-um fluency shaping as_well_as stuttering  modification .
62f,PAR,254571,263896,when they can't use their tools it's not because they're not  working hard or because they don't wanna it's because they can't do  it .
62f,PAR,263896,265567,it's really hard .
62f,PAR,269888,270631,okay .
62f,INV,0,8097,okay &-um so the first question is could you discuss the impact of  stuttering on your everyday life ?
62f,INV,8097,13905,for instance how it has impacted or impacts your job your family  your friends school .
62f,INV,15992,16736,yeah .
62f,INV,48704,59483,mhm and before that what had been the impact &-um <how it had> [/]  how it had limited you if it did &-um or changed the way in which  you interacted with people ?
62f,INV,89491,90871,okay sounds good .
62f,INV,90871,102173,&-um did you have treatment for your stuttering at any point in  time before all of this and if so <what seemed &-uh to be> [//] you  know just tell me about your therapy experiences .
62f,INV,102173,102253,okay .
62f,INV,136701,142242,alright &-um what would you describe as an example of successful  communication ?
62f,INV,142242,144315,as a goal what is successful communication ?
62f,INV,154567,159815,okay &-um if you had never stuttered how would your life have been  different ?
62f,INV,159815,159895,okay .
62f,INV,159895,159975,okay .
62f,INV,195497,202771,okay that's fair enough I'm not sure for anything what would be  different if for instance I were a foot taller than I am .
62f,INV,202771,205499,&-um what do you think causes stuttering ?
62f,INV,222111,223076,okay .
62f,INV,223076,224533,alright .
62f,INV,224533,235221,and last thing if you and this is interesting because you are an  s@l l@l p@l but if you could tell and s@l l@l p@l in training  something what would be the most important message you'd wanna give  ?
62f,INV,265567,267353,yeah okay I'd agree .
62f,INV,267353,269888,okay &-um that's basically it .
64m,PAR,199,399,&-uh <this is not the way I> [//] this is not the type of fluency I  have when I'm talking on the outside .
64m,PAR,8200,23740,so there's that .
64m,PAR,23740,23940,first question is please talk about the impact of stuttering on  your daily life .
64m,PAR,23940,38796,you can talk about your interactions with family and friends school  and or work and your participation in community activities .
64m,PAR,38796,48055,&-uh stuttering up until the age of forty &-uh completely consumed  me .
64m,PAR,48055,48255,&-um in interactions with family and friends .
64m,PAR,48255,57128,I don't think I was as close to my father as I should have been .
64m,PAR,57128,65285,because I always thought he was somehow judging me and I thought I  fell short of what he expected in a son .
64m,PAR,65285,73440,I was closer to my mother and I have two siblings a brother and a  sister and I don't think I'm close to them at all .
64m,PAR,73440,82013,&-uh school &-uh again it &-uh completely affected me .
64m,PAR,82013,82213,&-uh the courses I took were courses I wouldn't hafta speak in .
64m,PAR,82213,82413,&-uh when it did come time when I was forced into it when I was  forced into a seminar or something of that sort &-uh usually I took  the easy way out .
64m,PAR,82413,82613,I always managed to be sick on the day when I would hafta give a  presentation .
64m,PAR,82613,104756,something of that sort .
64m,PAR,104756,104956,or else I would give a very short presentation even though I knew  that it reflected badly on me .
64m,PAR,104956,122405,I simply thought that &-um that was not as bad as what would have  happened if I stood in front of the class and stuttered .
64m,PAR,122405,122605,&-uh work again I don't think I went as far in the job as I could  have been if I had &-uh xxx presentations and things like that .
64m,PAR,122605,122805,I was very happy I was very fortunate to find a very &-uh good  company to work at a very good employee it was a startup firm .
64m,PAR,122805,123005,and I think I was able to &-uh prove myself in other ways .
64m,PAR,123005,123205,and I think the boss simply found ways to make sure I could work  there without having to speak to clients .
64m,PAR,123205,123405,participation in community activities .
64m,PAR,123405,123605,that simply didn't happen .
64m,PAR,123605,123805,that would have been voluntary .
64m,PAR,123805,174308,and no that simply didn't happen .
64m,PAR,174308,180993,okay I'm going to end it here and start a different file for each  of the six questions .
64m,PAR,180993,185855,what do you think causes stuttering ?
64m,PAR,185855,191373,I've always assumed there was a genetic component to it .
64m,PAR,191373,195416,even though I'm the only person in my family who stutters .
64m,PAR,195416,195616,I can go back to my parents of course and to one set of  grandparents and there wasn't any stuttering there .
64m,PAR,195616,206495,I really don't know much about my father's parents .
64m,PAR,206495,206695,and I don't know anything at all about great grandparents and  people even back .
64m,PAR,206695,218180,but I've still always assumed there was a genetic &-uh component to  it .
64m,PAR,218180,218380,I think it's physical and I don't think it's psychological in any  way .
64m,PAR,218380,218580,I don't think there's anything in your upbringing that causes it .
64m,PAR,218580,218780,I don't think there's a way that you should raise a child who  stutters .
64m,PAR,218780,236561,I think it will happen or not happen .
64m,PAR,236561,240886,&-uh it's a completely physical phenomenon .
64m,PAR,240886,241086,I'm not sure <what that> [//] what the physical component is .
64m,PAR,241086,241286,I tend to think someday there will be a pill that cures it .
64m,PAR,241286,258751,I know they've tried finding such a thing and &-uh they came up  short but I think it'll happen sooner or later .
64m,PAR,258751,262895,I'm going to go on to the third question since that was short .
64m,PAR,262895,270685,if you have received treatment for your stuttering tell me about  your therapy experiences and the outcome of these therapies ?
64m,PAR,270685,280710,&-uh the first therapist I went to I was young because <my parents>  [//] I was starting high school so this was actually after eighth  grade .
64m,PAR,280710,280910,when I finally went to see a therapist .
64m,PAR,280910,291605,and my parents who didn't know much about it simply assumed I was  going to see a therapist once or twice and then I would be cured .
64m,PAR,291605,291805,&-uh that of course didn't happen <so> [//] but <they> [//] we  still stopped it .
64m,PAR,291805,301750,I didn't hafta go past it again .
64m,PAR,301750,301950,&-um after that it was graduate school that I next saw a therapist  .
64m,PAR,301950,302150,the graduate school I went to Purdue offered therapy for free to  its students .
64m,PAR,302150,302350,and I went there and that was actually a good experience .
64m,PAR,302350,325411,&-uh the first guy I saw was probably good but I didn't think I was  ready for it .
64m,PAR,325411,340403,<he would have me> [//] he would actually make phone calls and  pretend to stutter then he would hang up the phone and say you see  it wasn't all that bad it's not a bad experience .
64m,PAR,340403,340603,and I wasn't ready for something like that .
64m,PAR,340603,340803,I think it was a very important lesson but I wasn't ready to accept  it .
64m,PAR,340803,353671,I found that I was a little bit embarrassed hearing him stutter  because I thought he was mimicking me .
64m,PAR,353671,362963,when I gotta graduate school &-uh things were essentially  breathing techniques and other things like that .
64m,PAR,362963,363163,and it helped a great deal and they tried to tell me just keep  talking take the opportunity to talk in class .
64m,PAR,363163,363363,and I think that was good but actually even in graduate school I  wasn't ready to accept that .
64m,PAR,363363,388013,I was about forty years old when I joined <the> [//] one of the  chapters for the n@l s@l a@l the local chapter here in south Jersey  .
64m,PAR,388013,394430,and somebody there who is now a good friend of mine was a speech  language pathologist .
64m,PAR,394430,398356,and she said to me she was quoting someone .
64m,PAR,398356,398556,stuttering is what happens when you try not to stutter .
64m,PAR,398556,408335,<and that was &-uh> [//] I was ready to understand what she meant  by that .
64m,PAR,408335,412311,and she went on to say you should stutter on purpose .
64m,PAR,412311,412511,and that was actually a very good xxx practice that day at the  chapter meeting .
64m,PAR,412511,412711,and &-uh again at the age of forty I was ready to understand .
64m,PAR,412711,426148,I don't think I would have understood it sooner .
64m,PAR,426148,430445,so that's pretty much my experience with therapy .
64m,PAR,430445,447555,the fourth question is please describe what successful  communication means to you can you give an example of a positive  communicative experience .
64m,PAR,447555,447755,successful communication means fluency to me .
64m,PAR,447755,452521,fluency is still very important to me .
64m,PAR,452521,465268,there could be minor stuttering in fact stuttering I think is very  useful I think it's a way of expressing what you're trying to say  when you're trying to reach for a certain word .
64m,PAR,465268,465468,I'm not put off by it .
64m,PAR,465468,472188,but then there's stuttering and <there's stuttering> [/] there's  stuttering and then there's a speech impairment .
64m,PAR,472188,478205,&-uh successful communication means essentially fluent to me .
64m,PAR,478205,490706,do I have an experience <of a positive communicative> [//] of  positive communication .
64m,PAR,490706,496820,&-um yeah I think like most people who stutter I have cycles I have  good days and bad days .
64m,PAR,496820,501501,so I've had lots_of good days these are xxx I am very fluent .
64m,PAR,501501,501701,so yes that has happened &-uh and then example would be just  anything at all .
64m,PAR,501701,523073,usually at the chapter meeting for the n@l s@l a@l I tend to be  very fluent there because I know those people so well and the usual  thing they know that I stutter so I'm not trying to hide things from  them .
64m,PAR,523073,525413,xxx .
64m,PAR,525413,532581,if you didn't stutter what might be different in your life ?
64m,PAR,532581,532781,I can give &-um one word answer to that .
64m,PAR,532781,541873,that would be everything absolutely everything would be different  in my life .
64m,PAR,541873,548691,I think my &-uh work prospects would have been very different .
64m,PAR,548691,559140,I think I would have moved on for the p@l h@l d@l which I couldn't  handle I was having trouble with my major professor .
64m,PAR,559140,571285,&-uh because I wasn't answering his questions and it wasn't his  fault it was my fault I wasn't able to answer his questions I wasn't  able to do a good job things like that .
64m,PAR,571285,579875,and at the end of it I didn't move on to some other professor or to  some other university because I was so completely depressed by it .
64m,PAR,579875,580075,&-uh just about everything my personal life would have been  different .
64m,PAR,580075,580275,I'm a long standing bachelor lifetime bachelor I just couldn't meet  up with anybody so <I> [//] my family experiences would have been  different .
64m,PAR,580275,580475,sometimes I wonder if this is actually something that occurred  because_of the stuttering or is it because I held myself back .
64m,PAR,580475,580675,and my answer now is that it's because I held myself back .
64m,PAR,580675,580875,I don't think this hadta happen .
64m,PAR,580875,581075,but &-uh that's not the answer I would have given up until the age  of forty or so .
64m,PAR,581075,581275,I would have said I have a physical impairment that stops me and  I'm not a long distance runner because I physically I can't do  something like that and for the same reason there are things I can't  achieve because I have a physical impairment .
64m,PAR,581275,645988,but now I don't think that I think I was holding myself back .
64m,PAR,645988,662248,the sixth and last question is what else would you wanna say to  students or the general public to help them learn about stuttering  or ways to support people who stutter ?
64m,PAR,662248,679140,well as far as students go I think <the most important thing you  can teach> [//] &-uh the most important thing you can learn is that  the stutterer is holding himself back even if he is not ready to  accept something like that .
64m,PAR,679140,682383,<he &~so> [//] he is holding himself back .
64m,PAR,682383,689990,and that's what you hafta do with your clients you hafta make sure  they come to understand that .
64m,PAR,689990,690190,and the most important thing that you can tell your client is to  simply talk .
64m,PAR,690190,710841,don't worry about talking in stuttering don't worry too much about  fluency simply always say what you wanna say when you're in a  restaurant always order the food that you wanna order never what you  can pronounce .
64m,PAR,710841,715453,if you're talking to somebody always say what you wanna say .
64m,PAR,715453,715653,never &-uh water it down change it around do something like that .
64m,PAR,715653,728188,never back out_of a discussion and it doesn't matter how much you  stutter the important thing is that you talk .
64m,PAR,728188,728388,the stuttering will lesson on its own .
64m,PAR,728388,734305,that's something I've learned myself .
64m,PAR,734305,741273,I didn't learn that until <I was> [//] really when I reached middle  years .
64m,PAR,741273,746906,and that's unfortunate I wish I had learned that at an earlier age  .
64m,PAR,746906,751350,okay that concludes all six questions then .
24mb,PAR,13112,16427,okay so I am the only person <in my family> [/] in my family that  stutters .
24mb,PAR,16427,16627,&-uh and for a while stuttering kind of +//.
24mb,PAR,16627,16827,and stuttering won .
24mb,PAR,16827,17027,&-uh when I was growing up .
24mb,PAR,17027,23933,I always questioned like am I the only one that stuttered ?
24mb,PAR,23933,25534,how will this impact future jobs ?
24mb,PAR,25534,27334,could someone see past the fact that I stutter ?
24mb,PAR,27334,27534,will this affect friendships ?
24mb,PAR,27534,27734,or relationships ?
24mb,PAR,27734,29801,whatever the case may be .
24mb,PAR,29801,33338,but as I got older .
24mb,PAR,33338,34739,and did speech therapy .
24mb,PAR,34739,36173,and then when back to speech therapy .
24mb,PAR,36173,38775,&-um I gained a sense of acceptance .
24mb,PAR,38775,42358,and [/] and no I'm <not the only one that can see past> [//] not  the only one that stutters .
24mb,PAR,42358,44344,and yes people can see past it .
24mb,PAR,44344,46945,and no it will not affect &-uh my job .
24mb,PAR,46945,50595,&-uh prospects .
24mb,PAR,50595,54297,&-um stuttering doesn't define me as a person .
24mb,PAR,54297,56147,like <I don't> [//] I try not to let it .
24mb,PAR,56147,56347,there are days when it does .
24mb,PAR,56347,59413,but I don't let stuttering define me .
24mb,PAR,59413,63568,and in a way <I'm think I'm glad I'm stutter> [//] I'm glad I  stutter .
24mb,PAR,63568,63768,because I don't know where I would .
24mb,PAR,63768,63968,I don't who [/] who I would be as a person .
24mb,PAR,63968,67246,if I did not stutter .
24mb,PAR,67246,67251,oh .
24mb,PAR,67251,67451,oh because when I was little .
24mb,PAR,67451,67651,it was xxx .
24mb,PAR,67651,67851,I had a_lot_of questions and doubts .
24mb,PAR,77977,84505,but it was something I did not talk about .
24mb,PAR,84505,86596,but I just ignored the fact that I stutter .
24mb,PAR,86596,86796,didn't wanna acknowledge it .
24mb,PAR,86796,86996,there <were times> [//] a_lot_of times in class .
24mb,PAR,86996,94267,where I would not you know raise my hand .
24mb,PAR,94267,94467,because didn't wanna +//.
24mb,PAR,94467,94667,what if I stutter ?
24mb,PAR,94667,94867,and what if this .
24mb,PAR,94867,98402,and what if that .
24mb,PAR,98402,102338,&-um now [/] nowadays not so much .
24mb,PAR,102338,102538,the only thing that it does affect me is drivethroughs .
24mb,PAR,102538,105404,I don't do drivethroughs .
24mb,PAR,105404,107207,it's very seldom thing .
24mb,PAR,107207,107407,and then mentally it's the mental gymnastics .
24mb,PAR,107407,107607,well I don't care that I stutter .
24mb,PAR,107607,112708,but does this person care that I stutter ?
24mb,PAR,112708,114858,if I want them to make sure that it's not a big deal .
24mb,PAR,114858,115058,the whole back and forth .
24mb,PAR,115058,115258,the whole gymnastics .
24mb,PAR,115258,115458,of making sure that the person on the other end .
24mb,PAR,115458,119960,is okay with the fact that I stutter .
24mb,PAR,119960,121213,and she knows that it's not a big deal .
24mb,PAR,121213,121293,yes .
24mb,PAR,121293,121493,okay definitely .
24mb,PAR,133102,139203,so &-um I went to speech therapy from the ages of five to about  eleven .
24mb,PAR,139203,139403,twelve years old .
24mb,PAR,139403,147639,and by the time of the end of that speech therapy I was &-uh normal  .
24mb,PAR,147639,150076,&-um you couldn't tell that I stuttered .
24mb,PAR,150076,152660,I didn't identify as someone that stuttered .
24mb,PAR,152660,156063,and that's how it was for many [/] many years .
24mb,PAR,156063,156263,for about up until I was eighteen .
24mb,PAR,156263,158063,so six seven years .
24mb,PAR,158063,160340,I only remember stuttering twice .
24mb,PAR,160340,162866,during [/] during that entire [/] entire time period .
24mb,PAR,162866,163066,&-um when I was eighteen and <in> [//] a senior in high school .
24mb,PAR,163066,167267,my stuttering came back .
24mb,PAR,167267,167467,&-uh my parents attributed it to nerves .
24mb,PAR,167467,172438,and excitement about graduating high school .
24mb,PAR,172438,172638,moving out_of state .
24mb,PAR,172638,172838,new college .
24mb,PAR,172838,173038,new experiences .
24mb,PAR,173038,176271,etcetera [/] etcetera .
24mb,PAR,176271,176471,but we thought it would &-uh go away .
24mb,PAR,176471,181124,once I got useta it .
24mb,PAR,181124,183470,once I got acclimated to my new environment .
24mb,PAR,183470,185025,that did not happen .
24mb,PAR,185025,185225,&-um so my [/] my first years of college .
24mb,PAR,185225,189160,I ignored the fact that I stuttered .
24mb,PAR,189160,189360,didn't do anything about it .
24mb,PAR,189360,189560,&-um but my [/] my parents kept on pushing and pushing .
24mb,PAR,189560,189760,like hey see what they hafta offer .
24mb,PAR,189760,196798,see what they hafta offer .
24mb,PAR,196798,196998,and I was like yeah .
24mb,PAR,196998,198864,I'll do that .
24mb,PAR,198864,199064,<when hell> [/] when hell freezes over .
24mb,PAR,199064,201683,pigs fly .
24mb,PAR,201683,201883,etcetera [/] etcetera .
24mb,PAR,201883,202083,&-um another family member mentioned the same thing .
24mb,PAR,202083,206370,and so I did go back .
24mb,PAR,206370,209136,&-um I went back my junior year of college .
24mb,PAR,209136,213273,when I was like three or four years younger than the clinicians .
24mb,PAR,213273,213473,and that was more +//.
24mb,PAR,213473,219974,<the> [//] <my [/] my time during> [//] my time in that session .
24mb,PAR,219974,220174,wasn't about &-uh using techniques .
24mb,PAR,220174,224345,which I did &-uh learn and relearn .
24mb,PAR,224345,227249,but more about accepting the fact that I stutter .
24mb,PAR,227249,230113,and just incorporating stuttering into my everyday life .
24mb,PAR,230113,232798,of how can I get better at phone calls .
24mb,PAR,232798,233865,job interviews .
24mb,PAR,233865,234065,public speaking .
24mb,PAR,234065,235668,and that's what we focused on .
24mb,PAR,235668,239069,incorporating &-uh the techniques into those elements .
24mb,PAR,239069,240335,of my everyday life .
24mb,PAR,240335,240535,but once I +...
24mb,PAR,240535,247506,<so I stopped> [/] &-uh I stopped &-uh speech therapy when [//]  once I graduated college .
24mb,PAR,247506,247706,I have not been back .
24mb,PAR,247706,249956,and that's been two years .
24mb,PAR,249956,250156,nor do I plan on going back .
24mb,PAR,250156,252202,because I'm good with it .
24mb,PAR,261430,265965,&-um when my message is clear .
24mb,PAR,265965,268047,and I get my message [/] message across .
24mb,PAR,268047,270200,with &-uh very few disfluencies .
24mb,PAR,270200,270400,but if I do stutter a lot .
24mb,PAR,270400,272756,then so be it .
24mb,PAR,272756,274518,as long as my message is clear .
24mb,PAR,274518,274718,and if I needta repeat myself .
24mb,PAR,274718,276719,then I'll repeat myself .
24mb,PAR,276719,279572,but as long as the person understands what I'm saying .
24mb,PAR,279572,280788,then we're good .
24mb,PAR,280788,280793,oh !
24mb,PAR,287191,289127,what do I think causes stuttering ?
24mb,PAR,289127,292313,&-um I think <it> [//] it's &-uh genetics .
24mb,PAR,292313,292513,&-uh something +//.
24mb,PAR,292513,294762,whether it's a mutation .
24mb,PAR,294762,301231,or what [/] <what> [//] probably a mutation or series of mutations  .
24mb,PAR,301231,301431,somewhere down the line .
24mb,PAR,319039,320558,okay .
24mb,PAR,330462,335112,okay &-um first off for [/] for [/] for younger kids .
24mb,PAR,335112,335312,since I started speech therapy experiences from both a young child  .
24mb,PAR,335312,339533,and a young adult .
24mb,PAR,339533,340964,attack it from both angles .
24mb,PAR,340964,344785,<from a young> [/] from a [/] a young child's perspective .
24mb,PAR,344785,347966,&-uh assure the parents that it's okay .
24mb,PAR,347966,348166,that there's nothing wrong .
24mb,PAR,348166,348366,that it's okay .
24mb,PAR,348366,351922,assure the child that it's okay .
24mb,PAR,351922,352122,it's okay to stutter .
24mb,PAR,352122,354891,and they're not the only ones .
24mb,PAR,354891,357908,&-uh and help them achieve their goals .
24mb,PAR,357908,358108,in the same sense .
24mb,PAR,358108,358308,&-uh for young adults .
24mb,PAR,358308,358508,they probably know that they're not the only ones .
24mb,PAR,358508,365427,but help them with their goals .
24mb,PAR,365427,367011,whatever that may be .
24mb,PAR,367011,369931,&-um don't force your agenda on them .
24mb,PAR,369931,372032,let them create <the one agenda> [//] their own agenda .
24mb,PAR,372032,374260,and don't follow the [/] the textbook .
24mb,PAR,374260,377150,just because chapter six of book whatever says you hafta do this .
24mb,PAR,377150,377350,don't do it .
24mb,PAR,377350,379284,because the textbook doesn't fit everyone .

24mb,INV,280788,284006,&-uh sort of a tricky question .

24mb,INV,310751,310951,&-uh you've come up to the last question .

24mb,INV,319239,319439,among other people .
24mb,INV,319439,319639,and what would be a message ?
24mb,INV,320558,324693,that you might wanna give .
24mb,INV,324693,327092,to a future speech pathologist ?

54f,PAR,177534,182345,and the emotions just flowed .
54f,PAR,182345,182545,and ↫si-si↫since then I've been trying to be more opened with my  ↫s↫stuttering .
54f,PAR,182545,198268,↫talk-t-t↫talking about it (.) for the first time .

54f,PAR,247600,247800,and s:aid I was going to this conference .
54f,PAR,247800,248000,they asked ≠what .
54f,PAR,248000,258632,and I said the ↫na↫national s^tuttering association .
54f,PAR,258632,263330,and I said ≠I'm a ↫per↫person who stutters .
54f,PAR,263330,273233,and that [//] for me that's like ≠a very &-um and <just so> [//]  sometimes so rare .
54f,PAR,273233,276932,you asked about family .
54f,PAR,276932,281745,family was very [/] very [/] very ↫d-d↫difficult .
54f,PAR,281745,285497,I first started ↫st-st↫stuttering at age seven .

54f,PAR,301966,307515,<I was> [//] it was my turn to read (.) in the circle .

54f,PAR,317749,322982,&-uh and they thought (.) &-um I didn't know it .
54f,PAR,322982,327599,I knew it I just ↫co-co-co↫couldn't say it .
54f,PAR,327599,333463,&-um so that's what they thought .
54f,PAR,333463,342029,and (.) ≠I [/] I never really <↫t-t-t↫talked about> [/]  ↫talk↫talked about it with my family .
54f,PAR,342029,345557,<it just> [/] it just didn't happen .

54f,PAR,353215,366347,definitely my f:irst husband my s:econd husband did later on in [/]  in [/] in our marriage .
54f,PAR,366347,376928,&-um so ↫ta-ta↫talking about it with family <just didn't> [/] just  didn't really happen .
54f,PAR,376928,385330,with [/] with [/] with a couple of my ↫c-c↫close friends I [/] I  could .
54f,PAR,385330,402379,&-um with my family when I would tell them I was ↫c-c↫coming [/]  coming to these conferences I just s:aid I was ↫c↫coming to get  ↫c-c-c↫credits for [/] for my ↫cer-c↫certification .
54f,PAR,402379,412696,&-um yeah &-uh is there something ≠↫e↫else you wanted me to [/] to  talk about ?
54f,PAR,412696,417963,oh [/] oh [/] oh I'm sorry I went to [/] to long .
54f,PAR,417963,418043,okay .
54f,PAR,418043,422231,okay .
54f,PAR,424381,431523,okay &-um ≠I have two [/] two thoughts .
54f,PAR,431523,440197,I [/] I do believe it can be ↫g↫genetic or heredity .
54f,PAR,440197,443265,I [/] I definitely know that .
54f,PAR,443265,446912,in my case it was trauma .
54f,PAR,446912,454934,you know being [//] having that awful ↫ex↫experience as a seven [/]  seven year old child .
54f,PAR,454934,464848,and just <what it> [//] what ↫t-t-t↫transpired (.) <the whole> [//]  my whole journey .
54f,PAR,464848,474978,and a_lot_of people think xxx emotion ↫i↫it's not really  ↫ps↫ps:ychological .
54f,PAR,474978,481847,perhaps but I [//] for me it truly was trauma .
54f,PAR,481847,489143,so that's [/] that's [/] that's how I feel for [/] for [/] for my  story .
54f,PAR,496178,505163,I never got ↫t↫t:herapy for myself (.) until I was in my early  fifties .
54f,PAR,510300,516195,&-um well <I went to a> [/] I went to a ↫week↫weekend [/] weekend  workshop .
54f,PAR,516195,524330,where [//] at a college where &-um I was so [/] so out_of my  comfort zone .
54f,PAR,524330,530128,but I &-um worked with ↫grad↫≠graduate students .
54f,PAR,530128,535045,<but ≠they> [//] but <I was> [/] I was the client .
54f,PAR,535045,541579,and it was very [/] very ↫ch-ch-ch↫challenging .
54f,PAR,541579,548544,v:ery much out_of my ≠comfort zone .
54f,PAR,548544,552243,but I learned so much .
54f,PAR,552243,555811,and it [//] emotional very .
54f,PAR,555811,561662,and afterwards I wrote an article .
54f,PAR,561662,564527,and I called it the other side of the table .
54f,PAR,564527,564727,where I was not the s@l l@l p@l .
54f,PAR,564727,571729,I was the [/] the client .
54f,PAR,571729,575144,and I did it two [/] two [/] two times .
54f,PAR,575144,583046,and (.) wonderful ↫ch-ch-ch-chal↫challenging ≠experience .
54f,PAR,596361,611442,well ↫c-c-c↫communication is &-um (.) what [/] what [/] what [/]  what you wanna say not [/] not how you're saying it .
54f,PAR,611442,625810,but &-um positive &-uh [//] gotta think quickly &-uhoh .
54f,PAR,625810,639294,I guess positive was <I gave> [//] I actually gave a [/] a [/] a  workshop on s:tuttering to my whole group of ≠colleagues in the  schools .
54f,PAR,639294,642511,↫th-th↫three hours .
54f,PAR,642511,645408,for an in [/] in service day .
54f,PAR,645408,668028,and I think the most ↫po↫positive was ≠within a minute of my [//]  the beg^inning of my presentation I right away said <I'm a  ↫per-per↫person or I'm sorry> [//] I'm a ↫co↫covert ↫p-p↫person who  stutters .
54f,PAR,668028,676376,and I said it out loud to ↫tw-t-t-t↫twenty five colleagues <in the>  [/] in the workshop .
54f,PAR,676376,691876,and (.) my colleagues were blown away (.) <by that> [/] by that  ≠experience and me ≠telling them that and I think that was it .
54f,PAR,691876,693659,that was it .
54f,PAR,698945,704344,&-um I wouldn't be here .
54f,PAR,704344,706999,it's a simple answer .
54f,PAR,706999,712095,but ↫it-it↫it's what I ↫tr↫truly believe .
54f,PAR,712095,716678,I wouldn't be ↫s-s-s↫sitting with you this afternoon .
54f,PAR,716678,722827,and be at this amazing ↫c-c↫conference which [/] which [/] which is  my thirteenth .
54f,PAR,722827,725992,that [//] simple answer .
54f,PAR,735710,742026,first of all come [/] come [/] come to the n@l s@l a@l .
54f,PAR,742026,757360,I always tell (.) &-um (.) first timers (.) ≠parents it will be  life [/] life changing .
54f,PAR,757360,763745,and that's what I ≠↫e-e↫express to them .
54f,PAR,763745,774774,&-uh ≠I [/] I think that's how I feel .
54f,INV,199,399,please talk about the impact of stuttering on your daily life .
54f,INV,399,15554,you can talk about your interactions with family and friends school  or work and your participation in community activities .
54f,INV,15554,15754,yes I have more questions but I didn't wanna cut you off .
54f,INV,15754,15954,absolutely not .
54f,INV,15954,16154,these are your answer is great .
54f,INV,422231,424381,what do you think causes stuttering ?
54f,INV,424381,424581,if you have received treatment for your stuttering +//.
54f,INV,489143,496178,have you received treatment ?
54f,INV,505163,510300,okay so can you tell me about your therapy experiences and the  outcomes ?
54f,INV,583046,596361,please describe what successful communication means to you and can  you give an example of a positive communicative experience ?
54f,INV,693659,698945,if you didn't stutter what would what might be different in your  life ?
54f,INV,725992,735710,what else would you wanna say to students or the general public to  help them learn about stuttering or ways to support people who  stutter ?
50fa,PAR,12174,14575,currently or in the past ?
50fa,PAR,14575,14775,(be)cause that could be a long one .
50fa,PAR,17811,23896,stuttering has had a variety of impacts on me .
50fa,PAR,23896,32867,I think for years it led me to be much more introverted .
50fa,PAR,32867,33067,one of the things from it though .
50fa,PAR,33067,36637,is that I got very good at watching .
50fa,PAR,36637,36837,I got very good at watching and listening to people .
50fa,PAR,36837,40188,especially groups of people .
50fa,PAR,40188,44006,and I wound up using that later in my career .
50fa,PAR,44006,49009,in terms of working with people as a counselor .
50fa,PAR,49009,52709,and now as a therapist .
50fa,PAR,52709,57413,so it actually honed my observational skills .
50fa,PAR,57413,57613,but at the time it was very [/] very hard .
50fa,PAR,57613,57813,especially in that later grade school .
50fa,PAR,57813,63730,and junior high .
50fa,PAR,63730,65035,phase .
50fa,PAR,65035,70904,and I would say that probably shame was a huge component .
50fa,PAR,70904,74173,in terms of always feeling like there's something wrong .
50fa,PAR,74173,75190,that I was doing something wrong .
50fa,PAR,75190,75390,and [/] and then eventually coming to a place .
50fa,PAR,75390,81943,where I realized that I wasn't doing anything wrong .
50fa,PAR,81943,82143,but it took many years .
50fa,PAR,82143,82343,and it took a_lot_of getting to know people .
50fa,PAR,82343,88346,and being around the stuttering community .
50fa,PAR,88346,91547,for that to really sort of sink in .
50fa,PAR,91547,97868,so that's the Reader's_Digest version of it .
50fa,PAR,97868,100368,I could talk on that for two hours and a half .
50fa,PAR,100368,100448,so +...
50fa,PAR,100448,100648,&=laughs .
50fa,PAR,100648,100848,mhm I did .
50fa,PAR,112272,114776,sure .
50fa,PAR,114776,114976,first therapy was at age seven .
50fa,PAR,114976,122379,and all that I remember from it was lying on a table breathing .
50fa,PAR,122379,125863,and her name was Name .
50fa,PAR,125863,126063,and I can remember liking her .
50fa,PAR,126063,126263,but I remember literally just laying out .
50fa,PAR,126263,126463,and working on breath .
50fa,PAR,126463,126663,which is interesting .
50fa,PAR,126663,136303,because breath is still an issue for me now .
50fa,PAR,136303,138634,the next year .
50fa,PAR,138634,142791,and so I didn't have any other therapy until fifth grade .
50fa,PAR,142791,142991,and that was pretty annoying .
50fa,PAR,142991,150336,because <they had> [/] they had me reading to parent volunteers .
50fa,PAR,150336,151758,the whole Wizard_Of_Oz books .
50fa,PAR,151758,151958,which I had already read .
50fa,PAR,151958,153910,by that point .
50fa,PAR,153910,154110,so I was like why am I reading this ?
50fa,PAR,154110,159431,when I've read it before ?
50fa,PAR,159431,159631,then I had therapy in sixth grade .
50fa,PAR,159631,159831,and at that point .
50fa,PAR,159831,160031,sixth grade .
50fa,PAR,160031,167301,you're top of the elementary school food chain .
50fa,PAR,167301,167501,and what she had me do is help make paper clowns .
50fa,PAR,167501,173136,and cut out activities for the younger kids .
50fa,PAR,173136,178640,so went to a private psychologist .
50fa,PAR,178640,178840,seventh grade .
50fa,PAR,178840,182958,and biofeedback was just starting to come out .
50fa,PAR,182958,185641,so I worked on biofeedback .
50fa,PAR,185641,185841,relaxation skills .
50fa,PAR,185841,188881,which was very helpful for my later work .
50fa,PAR,188881,190846,but not real helpful in terms of speech .
50fa,PAR,190846,196664,then after that went to a private therapist .
50fa,PAR,196664,200031,the xxx stuff was coming out .
50fa,PAR,200031,202683,so I did the precision fluency shaping .
50fa,PAR,202683,202763,targets .
50fa,PAR,202763,208337,and I'll tell you holding syllables for two seconds as a twelve  year old .
50fa,PAR,208337,208537,as a preteenager .
50fa,PAR,208537,208737,was really [/] really tough .
50fa,PAR,208737,219224,when I was in high school I had the first one I consider good  therapy .
50fa,PAR,219224,219424,I'm always grateful I've gone to the local chair of the  communicative disorders in college .
50fa,PAR,219224,229897,I think he's he either was in Alabama .
50fa,PAR,229897,230097,or Mississippi .
50fa,PAR,230097,230297,few years back .
50fa,PAR,230297,235547,and it was the first guy that said how do you feel .
50fa,PAR,235547,235747,about your stuttering .
50fa,PAR,235747,235947,and I can still remember .
50fa,PAR,235947,239702,clear as day .
50fa,PAR,239702,242203,and then he said how do you feel .
50fa,PAR,242203,244104,I said it sucks .
50fa,PAR,244104,244304,and [/] and so we started working on things .
50fa,PAR,244304,249596,and he was the first person that pointed that I drop my chin .
50fa,PAR,249596,249796,as one of my secondaries .
50fa,PAR,249796,255450,so I worked with him on and off for about a year and a half .
50fa,PAR,255450,255650,and I started thinking what else did I needta do .
50fa,PAR,255650,261093,and I started actually volunteering at a peer hot line .
50fa,PAR,261093,265229,and doing things that I knew I needed to not avoid .
50fa,PAR,265229,271182,and [/] and then a other high school therapist took over .
50fa,PAR,271182,271382,and she was really tough as nails with me .
50fa,PAR,271382,271582,which is what I needed .
50fa,PAR,271582,277935,(be)cause by that point I could b@l s@l the therapists .
50fa,PAR,277935,278135,I knew +//.
50fa,PAR,278135,278335,as I think Name spoke the other night .
50fa,PAR,278335,283630,I knew stuttering therapy as_well_as they did .
50fa,PAR,283630,283830,and I feel now for the grad students .
50fa,PAR,283830,289158,that worked with me .
50fa,PAR,289158,289358,(be)cause I've been a grad student .
50fa,PAR,289358,293895,so I [/] I have sympathies for them .
50fa,PAR,293895,293975,but +//.
50fa,PAR,293975,294175,and then I took a break .
50fa,PAR,294175,294375,and then in college .
50fa,PAR,294375,300714,my speech took a pretty severe nose dive .
50fa,PAR,300714,304666,went out to the xxx program .
50fa,PAR,304666,304866,when I was like a junior .
50fa,PAR,304866,310017,and [/] and I would say my life changed after that .
50fa,PAR,310017,313969,I still thought voluntary stuttering was the craziest thing in the  planet .
50fa,PAR,313969,318213,but that kind of advertising and voluntary stuttering .
50fa,PAR,318213,318413,I found that to be one of the most helpful techniques .
50fa,PAR,318413,321955,I still use it to this day .
50fa,PAR,321955,325611,and then I had think I had one other short term therapy .
50fa,PAR,325611,331162,after about two years after out_of college .
50fa,PAR,331162,331362,but at that point .
50fa,PAR,331362,334964,I said I need a coach .
50fa,PAR,334964,335164,I need somebody that can help me fine tune .
50fa,PAR,335164,335364,get the curve ball .
50fa,PAR,335364,335564,get the +//.
50fa,PAR,335564,335764,you know that .
50fa,PAR,335764,335964,by that point I had been coming to the n@l s@l p@l and +//.
50fa,PAR,335964,346901,actually I started with the n@l c@l o@l s@l .
50fa,PAR,346901,347101,and then n@l s@l p@l .
50fa,PAR,347101,351088,and then n@l s@l a@l .
50fa,PAR,351088,351288,so at that point I knew what I needed .
50fa,PAR,351288,356121,I just needed some help and support doing it .
50fa,PAR,356121,361493,so_that last therapy experience was quite some number of years ago  .
50fa,PAR,379251,382186,so Name stole my line the other night .
50fa,PAR,382186,387456,but for years what I've been saying is it's not about fluency .
50fa,PAR,387456,389171,it's about freedom from the fear .
50fa,PAR,389171,389371,and one of my lines that I say when I talk to students .
50fa,PAR,389371,393707,is we are more than our mouth .
50fa,PAR,393707,393907,and so can I say what I wanna say ?
50fa,PAR,393907,399212,can I be a good communicator ?
50fa,PAR,399212,402360,regardless of how I stutter .
50fa,PAR,402360,406865,and the other piece I say is to be able to use my tools when I need  it .
50fa,PAR,406865,407065,and lately I've been going through <a fairly> [/] a fairly rough  patch .
50fa,PAR,407065,412605,the last year .
50fa,PAR,412605,418212,and [/] and I've had experiences where my tools have not been  workable for me .
50fa,PAR,418212,418412,so I'm at that reevaluative@c +//.
50fa,PAR,418412,418612,that's not a word .
50fa,PAR,418612,418812,but the reevaluation period .
50fa,PAR,418812,426288,of what do I needta do ?
50fa,PAR,426288,429323,and how best to go about doing it .
50fa,PAR,439412,442125,yeah I have .
50fa,PAR,442125,442325,I don't know how I'd answer it right now .
50fa,PAR,442325,442525,that's a hard one .
50fa,PAR,442525,452816,I haven't thought about that in quite some time .
50fa,PAR,452816,456219,I do know in some ways that my life would be less rich .
50fa,PAR,456219,457942,from all the people I've met .
50fa,PAR,457942,458142,and that sounds cliche .
50fa,PAR,458142,461039,but that's really true .
50fa,PAR,461039,463740,I've got friends here that I've been friends with for over twenty  years .
50fa,PAR,463740,463940,I think I would probably have tried more .
50fa,PAR,463940,472328,whether that's more public speaking .
50fa,PAR,472328,472528,I mean I like teaching .
50fa,PAR,472528,474630,I love doing workshops .
50fa,PAR,474630,474830,I've done small group teaching .
50fa,PAR,474830,478963,and that kind of stuff .
50fa,PAR,478963,479163,the one non vocational thing .
50fa,PAR,479163,479363,I would have always wanted to do .
50fa,PAR,479363,486416,was to be a d@l j@l .
50fa,PAR,486416,486616,that sounds funny .
50fa,PAR,486616,486696,but .
50fa,PAR,486696,490970,I've always loved sequencing .
50fa,PAR,490970,491170,so_that kind of thing comes to mind .
50fa,PAR,491170,496358,but I think I would have taken more risks .
50fa,PAR,496358,496558,so I often times say it's the neuro developmental .
50fa,PAR,505852,515116,and so forth .
50fa,PAR,515116,517397,but I like to use Name's quote .
50fa,PAR,517397,521884,which I stole from Search_For_Intelligent_Life_In_The_Universe .
50fa,PAR,521884,524084,there's lapses in the synapses .
50fa,PAR,524084,528917,the signal is just not quite getting from here to here .
50fa,PAR,528917,533989,but that there are times that the train tracks work fine .
50fa,PAR,533989,537908,but there are times that there are things on the train tracks .
50fa,PAR,537908,545734,but what I say is that I believe it's a kernel of a physiological  signal disruption .
50fa,PAR,545734,550014,layered with emotional cognitive mental factors .
50fa,PAR,550014,550214,so it's kind of like a big jawbreaker .
50fa,PAR,559318,561809,0 [=! laughs ] .
50fa,PAR,561809,561889,xxx .
50fa,PAR,561889,562089,this is something that when I do talk to students on .
50fa,PAR,572208,580177,it's so hard to sum it up into a couple of things .
50fa,PAR,580177,583974,one thing that I often say is don't be scared of us .
50fa,PAR,583974,584174,there's such a reluctance .
50fa,PAR,584174,584374,because it is tough .
50fa,PAR,584374,591217,it's not like an artic@c disorder .
50fa,PAR,591217,591417,that sort of graduated .
50fa,PAR,591417,591617,and you're done .
50fa,PAR,591617,591817,there's all the ups and downs .
50fa,PAR,591817,597553,and I don't even know that I like the word relapse .
50fa,PAR,597553,597753,but so come learn from us .
50fa,PAR,597753,597953,live with us .
50fa,PAR,597953,604441,conference with us .
50fa,PAR,604441,604641,but there are things you can do .
50fa,PAR,604641,604841,and couple of things come to mind .
50fa,PAR,604841,611893,one is don't ask us to do something that you won't do .
50fa,PAR,611893,612093,and (be)cause I've I have talked to friends .
50fa,PAR,612093,612293,who have had speech therapists .
50fa,PAR,612293,612493,who wouldn't go out and do surveys .
50fa,PAR,612493,622748,or wouldn't go out and voluntary .
50fa,PAR,622748,622948,and yet ask us to .
50fa,PAR,622948,623148,and it's like that's the only way that I did it .
50fa,PAR,623148,623348,was I saw people going out and doing it first .
50fa,PAR,623348,623548,and went okay if they can do it .
50fa,PAR,623548,623748,then I can .
50fa,PAR,623748,634504,so put your money where your mouth is .
50fa,PAR,634504,634704,believe in us .
50fa,PAR,634704,634904,and that sounds cliche .
50fa,PAR,634904,635104,but I knew from those two .
50fa,PAR,635104,641805,that I finally had .
50fa,PAR,641805,642005,that they saw something .
50fa,PAR,642005,642205,believed in something .
50fa,PAR,642205,646339,that I didn't yet .
50fa,PAR,646339,646539,and so we are holders of hope .
50fa,PAR,646539,652112,and I think we needta hold that .
50fa,PAR,652112,652312,the other thing is there this is a very tricky line .
50fa,PAR,652312,652512,I still haven't quite reconciled it .
50fa,PAR,652512,652712,but those that had said you know if you can do it in here .
50fa,PAR,652712,661766,you can do it out there .
50fa,PAR,661766,667352,that whole transfer and carryover .
50fa,PAR,667352,667552,when I heard that when I was young .
50fa,PAR,667552,667752,I interpreted that to mean like oh if I'm not doing it out there .
50fa,PAR,667752,673955,then I'm doing it wrong .
50fa,PAR,673955,679724,and I know that they've said it to encourage me .
50fa,PAR,679724,679924,but I took it in a shame way .
50fa,PAR,679924,685834,rather than you can we needta do it out there .
50fa,PAR,685834,686034,so I think now there's much more attention paid to that transfer .
50fa,PAR,686034,686234,and how to do it outside .
50fa,PAR,686234,686434,because it's not hard to get us fluent .
50fa,PAR,686434,697534,in the setting .
50fa,PAR,697534,697734,it's actually relatively easy .
50fa,PAR,697734,697934,I mean it might not seem like it .
50fa,PAR,697934,698134,but so building in those things .
50fa,PAR,698134,698334,involving parents .
50fa,PAR,698334,712823,I think that's partly why I had become a family therapist .
50fa,PAR,712823,713023,because we needta look at the whole system .
50fa,PAR,713023,717092,and not just one piece .
50fa,PAR,717092,717292,and I think that is happening .
50fa,PAR,717292,717492,but I could go on .
50fa,PAR,717492,722779,but those are the ones that sort of come to mind .
50fa,PAR,722779,722859,first .
50fa,PAR,722859,724848,sure .
50fa,INV,199,399,or has had .
50fa,INV,399,7371,on your everyday life ?
50fa,INV,7371,8871,your friends .
50fa,INV,8871,9071,your family .
50fa,INV,9071,11089,your educational experiences .
50fa,INV,11089,12174,your work experiences .
50fa,INV,14575,16143,you can do anything you want .
50fa,INV,16143,17811,yeah .
50fa,INV,17811,18011,that's fine .
50fa,INV,18011,18211,&=laughs .
50fa,INV,100368,106788,so if you received therapy .
50fa,INV,106788,106988,for stuttering .
50fa,INV,106988,112272,can you sort of summarize those experiences ?
50fa,INV,112272,112472,and [/] and the outcomes of those experiences ?
50fa,INV,112472,112552,oh dear .
50fa,INV,112552,112752,&=laughs .
50fa,INV,112752,112832,okay .
50fa,INV,112832,112912,okay .
50fa,INV,112912,113112,so this +//.
50fa,INV,113112,113312,I think +//.
50fa,INV,113312,113512,given what you said .
50fa,INV,361493,373498,segues into what at this point does successful communication mean  to you ?
50fa,INV,373498,373698,and [/] and could you provide an example .
50fa,INV,373698,373898,or explain what successful communication looks like to you .
50fa,INV,373898,379251,at this point .
50fa,INV,379251,379331,mhm .
50fa,INV,379331,379531,so if you didn't stutter .
50fa,INV,429323,439412,what might have been different in your life ?
50fa,INV,439412,439612,have you ever had that thought ?
50fa,INV,439612,439692,hey .
50fa,INV,439692,439772,no hey .
50fa,INV,439772,439852,okay .
50fa,INV,439852,440052,<that sounds> [/] that sounds interesting .
50fa,INV,496358,501460,and good to me .
50fa,INV,501460,505852,do you have any thoughts about what you think causes stuttering at  this point ?
50fa,INV,550014,553447,yeah .
50fa,INV,553447,553647,sounds [/] sounds reasonable to me .
50fa,INV,553647,559318,and basically the last question is .
50fa,INV,559318,559518,the purpose of this .
50fa,INV,559518,559718,is if you had one thing +//.
50fa,INV,559718,559918,or you can say more than one thing .
50fa,INV,561809,568673,that you wanna say to students studying to be speech language  pathologists .
50fa,INV,568673,570125,and to work with people who stutter .
50fa,INV,570125,572208,what would you say to them ?
50fa,INV,572208,572288,yeah .
50fa,INV,572288,572368,okay .
50fa,INV,572368,572568,well thank you very much .
50fa,INV,724848,726081,I'm gonna turn this off .
26f,PAR,199,399,I started stuttering when I was in the beginning of elementary  school .
26f,PAR,6841,18288,so probably around six years old .
26f,PAR,18288,22800,I interestingly did not receive any sort of speech therapy until I  was seventeen .
26f,PAR,22800,24888,and a senior in high school .
26f,PAR,24888,29014,I think that was probably for a few different reasons .
26f,PAR,29014,29214,my mom is a person who stutters and so is my brother and I think  that she didn't wanna call too much attention to it .
26f,PAR,29214,29414,which in retrospect wasn't the healthiest thing .
26f,PAR,29414,29614,but I think she thought it would be best for me to kind of go under  the radar .
26f,PAR,29614,46591,so never had speech therapy in school .
26f,PAR,46591,53515,and then when I was seventeen I was at the point in my life where I  felt like stuttering was really holding me back from doing what I  wanted to do .
26f,PAR,53515,60618,I hadta take a class <in> [//] as a senior in high school that had  a significant public speaking component .
26f,PAR,60618,74019,&-um I was also applying to colleges I knew <I had job> [//] I had  college interviews to do and I was just becoming more and more  self-conscious and also becoming more covert .
26f,PAR,74019,81189,about my stuttering so I decided I needed help and that's when I  got therapy which really changed the way I look at my stuttering now  .
26f,PAR,81189,81389,go for it .
26f,PAR,81389,81589,yeah I did .
26f,PAR,81589,81789,sure so I had therapy not for so long .
26f,PAR,81789,81989,for a little bit under a year because I left to college .
26f,PAR,81989,82189,so I started therapy as a senior in high school at around November  .
26f,PAR,89212,104634,I remember because it was around Thanksgiving time .
26f,PAR,104634,108796,and my therapist was awesome .
26f,PAR,108796,116251,so she specialized in stuttering but she wasn't &~like board  recognized because she's from Canada and I think it works a little  differently there .
26f,PAR,116251,116451,but she had a_lot_of experiences working with people who stutter .
26f,PAR,116451,123300,and I think the most important thing is I really connected really  well with her .
26f,PAR,123300,134783,&-um her therapy program was pretty holistic in that it was a  combination of what we would call &~like fluency shaping and  stuttering modification .
26f,PAR,134783,140714,and a_lot_of counseling and desensitization work .
26f,PAR,140714,140914,so we did stuttering surveys in different places .
26f,PAR,140914,141114,and went to stores and had me really go through that fear hierarchy  of difficult speaking situations .
26f,PAR,141114,161437,and I think that the desensitization piece plus me feeling like I  could really trust her she was actually the first one who ever told  me that it was okay to stutter .
26f,PAR,161437,168588,and that I think was &~like the biggest thing (be)cause my whole  life I thought it wasn't okay just because it was something not  everyone does .
26f,PAR,168588,174104,but once I was told it was okay that was like a huge load off my  back .
26f,PAR,174104,176025,and everything else got easier .
26f,PAR,176025,176225,yeah so< I think that> [//] I know now there's a_lot_of research  about genetics and stuttering .
26f,PAR,179904,188240,I think in my case there's a strong genetic link .
26f,PAR,188240,188440,because my mom's a person who stutters and my brother .
26f,PAR,188440,188640,and interestingly her father and supposedly her grandfather so her  father's father though difficult to trace &-um because he wasn't  alive when she was .
26f,PAR,188640,188840,so I think genetics I know plus environmental factors both play a  role .
26f,PAR,188840,189040,and temperament I know there's research on temperament and how the  brain works .
26f,PAR,189040,223268,and the brain being activated in different maybe places in people  who stutter versus people who don't .
26f,PAR,223268,232241,and also about hemispheres and I know there's just a_lot_of  different research going on but I think it's a combination of  factors .
26f,PAR,243373,252314,so I think that successful communication doesn't mean a hundred  percent fluency especially for people who stutter because that's  just not going to happen .
26f,PAR,252314,256907,in most likely if you're really saying what you wanna say .
26f,PAR,256907,268155,&-um I think that for me I feel like I'm a successful communicator  when I'm saying what I wanna say when I wanna say it and when I'm  open with people about my stuttering .
26f,PAR,268155,268355,and I'm not trying to avoid stuttering .
26f,PAR,268355,278598,and I think an example of when I was successful is recently I was  interviewing for jobs .
26f,PAR,278598,282527,to work as a speech pathologist in a school .
26f,PAR,282527,300925,and I was really open with the principals who I was interviewing  with I told them that I'm a person who stutters and I have a special  interest in stuttering and I felt like that allowed me to &-um  communicate really effectively with them regardless of any  stuttering or even xxx .
26f,PAR,300925,301125,I wonder if I would have chosen my career as a speech language  pathologist .
26f,PAR,301125,301325,I know that as a child &-um in school especially in middle and high  school I would have volunteered more in class I would have given  more presentations .
26f,PAR,301325,301525,but I think that since I had therapy <for> [//] in college so when  I was in college and graduate school studying speech pathology I  felt like I was really able to &-um be open with people about my  stuttering .
26f,PAR,304818,343523,and I don't feel like now it really holds me back anymore except  for maybe some very &~like high pressure situations .
26f,PAR,343523,354434,&-um but overall I think that stuttering has helped me because it  did lead me to my job and my career and hopefully a long career  ahead of me .
26f,PAR,354434,354634,I hope so too .
26f,PAR,354634,368037,so last question if you have one thing you would like to say to  people watching the video to help them learn more about stuttering  or one last thought you wanna convey to students in training what  would it be ?
26f,PAR,368037,372866,the one thought that I would say is that stuttering is more complex  than you could see .
26f,PAR,372866,377346,&-um and also stuttering varies tremendously from day to day .
26f,PAR,377346,381608,so some days I speak fairly fluently without much effort .
26f,PAR,381608,385601,and other days I struggle more naturally .
26f,PAR,385601,390096,and it's just the way that it is it's not that I'm more anxious one  day or another day .
26f,PAR,390096,392771,it's not that I'm having a bad day .
26f,PAR,392771,394708,it's just the nature of stuttering essentially .
26f,PAR,394708,396312,it's really variable .
26f,PAR,396312,401612,and it's important for &~stu clinicians or student clinicians to be  aware of that .
26f,PAR,401612,404301,thank you !
26f,INV,199,6841,you know how it's impacted you .
26f,INV,6841,7041,&-um I'm going to skip a question here and come back to it later .
26f,INV,7041,7241,so you got therapy for your stuttering .
26f,INV,81189,89212,can you tell me about your experiences and outcomes ?
26f,INV,89212,89412,that's great .
26f,INV,176025,179904,do you have any ideas or thoughts about what causes stuttering ?
26f,INV,232241,234380,cool [/] cool &-um .
26f,INV,234380,234580,what do you think successful communication means to you ?
26f,INV,234580,243373,can you describe &~you_know a moment when you just felt you really  had an excellent communication experience ?
26f,INV,243373,243573,that's cool .
26f,INV,300925,304818,&-um if you didn't stutter would anything be different in your life  ?
26f,INV,304818,305018,good thank you .
37m,PAR,19556,36168,being a person who stutters there are many unique challenges that I  face every day .
37m,PAR,36168,36368,one of them for example is that my office is located in a very busy  area where there's always people coming and going .
37m,PAR,36368,97097,so naturally there are coworkers who come into say hello and it can  be a real struggle for me to maintain a conversation outside of hi  how are you how's it going .
37m,PAR,97097,130955,and every time I start stuttering I'm reminded of how my parents do  not and will not understand my stuttering in the way that I want  them to .
37m,PAR,130955,152279,it's my parents feelings that the shorter my sentences are the less  likely I will be to stutter .
37m,PAR,152279,162889,and that to me is just completely way off the beam .
37m,PAR,162889,203316,I mean nobody has ever told me what I can and can't say and nobody  will ever prevent me from saying what I want .
37m,PAR,208929,229452,my impression is that stuttering has always been genetic .
37m,PAR,229452,242769,I have not done any geniology research .
37m,PAR,242769,259029,but it has been my understanding that my <great great> [/] great  grandfather stuttered .
37m,PAR,259029,271579,yet no one else in my family does .
37m,PAR,271579,298669,and what I emphatically say is that my stuttering is not caused by  nerves and it is not caused by stress .
37m,PAR,308729,345376,well currently I am in speech therapy under the tutelage of a  brilliant speech therapist and she knows who she is .
37m,PAR,345376,366549,working with her and her staff I have been unlearning everything  all my former s@l l@l p@l have taught me .
37m,PAR,366549,395375,and what I am focused on now is just stuttering openly without any  guilt or shame and loving it .
37m,PAR,395375,422348,in fact I'm even open stuttering right now and I'm having a blast  doing it .
37m,PAR,434549,467502,anytime you say what you want that is the quintessential definition  of having a successful experience .
37m,PAR,467502,492285,to me anytime that I refuse to let my words trap me that is how I  define success .
37m,PAR,492285,523368,every time I speak at a stuttering conference and people here my  story yeah I think that's a great example of being successful .
37m,PAR,532443,545377,oh wow &-um okay I love working for the government .
37m,PAR,545377,545577,however there have been times that I had thought about going to law  school or possibly becoming a radio d@l j@l .
37m,PAR,545577,593572,yes I sometimes would fall asleep dreaming of me behind the  microphone .
37m,PAR,593572,593772,and I realize that it would probably have been very difficult to  make those dreams happen .
37m,PAR,593772,593972,but being a motivational speaker in many ways it's allowed me to  reach out and help others go for their dreams .
37m,PAR,593972,687725,and in a way others who go for their dreams help me realize that  just maybe I didn't miss out on my dreams after all .
37m,PAR,699204,714779,working with people who stutter is not just about the academic  component .
37m,PAR,714779,731274,I do understand that the classroom plays a very big role but .
37m,PAR,731274,731474,when you go for your masters in speech therapy you will learn that  a speech therapist is a advocate friend confidant .
37m,PAR,731474,773268,and sit back and enjoy the ride .
37m,PAR,773268,773468,because there will be times when it's challenging .
37m,PAR,773468,773668,they'll be times when you will wanna scream and curse .
37m,PAR,773668,818090,and maybe you'll get angry that your Saturday nights are non  existent .
37m,PAR,818090,818290,but in the end you will have achieved the greatest gift of all and  that is making a difference in someone's life .
37m,PAR,818290,858831,and right now more than ever that is what our world needs .
37m,INV,0,19556,please talk about the impact of stuttering on your daily life you  can talk about your interactions with family and friends school and  or work and your participation in community activities .
37m,INV,203316,208929,what do you think causes stuttering ?
37m,INV,298669,308729,if you have received treatment for your stuttering tell me about  your therapy experiences and the outcomes of these therapies .
37m,INV,422348,434549,please describe what successful communication means to you and can  you give an example of a positive communicative experience .
37m,INV,434549,434629,awesome .
37m,INV,523368,532443,if you didn't stutter what might be different in your life ?
37m,INV,687725,699204,what else would you wanna say to students or the general public to  help them learn about stuttering or ways to support people who  stutter ?
508,PAR,79,279,&-um just like [/] like present past or +...
508,PAR,279,479,<got it> [/] got it .
508,PAR,479,679,&-um &-well &-I_mean I guess I'll start in the past &-uh .
508,PAR,12225,31386,I'm thirty four now but I first started stuttering when I was &-um  seven years old .
508,PAR,31386,31586,so I had two cases of stuttering actually &-um .
508,PAR,31586,31786,from ages seven to ten .
508,PAR,31786,38973,and then I woke up one day and my stuttering was gone .
508,PAR,38973,43052,&-um had I did not stutter until age thirteen .
508,PAR,43052,46853,and then literally woke up one day and it was back to where it was  before .
508,PAR,46853,58611,so &-um definitely the impact of stuttering growing up was a lot  different &-um just because I didn't know anyone who stuttered .
508,PAR,58611,67611,&-uh I didn't know anyone who shared the same &-uh I think you  would call it &-like xxx or struggle .
508,PAR,67611,67811,&-um and then &-uh since at the time my stuttered originated &-uh  with reading .
508,PAR,67811,83732,so &-um but it was +...
508,PAR,83732,83932,I couldn't tell if I was mild or if I just was able to things to  kinda hide it .
508,PAR,83932,84132,and so when I did see s@l l@l p@l &-um they essentially both my  mother and I that hey there's nothing wrong with your son .
508,PAR,84132,98856,<there's no> [/] there's no reason to bring him to speech therapy .
508,PAR,98856,99056,and so imagine you know getting made fun of on &-uh on &-like a  irregular basis whenever stuttering came out .
508,PAR,99056,99256,and then being told that hey there's nothing wrong with you at like  the professional level .
508,PAR,99256,113187,so &-um +...
508,PAR,113187,118100,so stuttering definitely had a huge impact for I wanna say like two  decades .
508,PAR,118100,128452,&-um and then shortly before I went to my first stuttering group  &-um I kinda came to full acceptance of [/] of myself as an  individual .
508,PAR,128452,140543,and so probably by that time &-um &-like twenty eight twenty nine  onward &-uh stuttering it still would it come out but it didn't have  as much of an impact on me as possible .
508,PAR,140543,140743,&-um and &-uh fast forward from four years into since I had met my  first person who stuttered and I've met a whole bunch of other  people .
508,PAR,140743,163161,and so I think stuttering is impactful in the other direction of  just it I do come across people who stutter more often .
508,PAR,163161,163361,but I think it's driven into the shape of how other people feel  about it .
508,PAR,163361,163561,and helping them feel comfortable and acceptful@c of who they are .
508,PAR,163561,163761,I should be looking here .
508,PAR,163761,163961,not at you .
508,PAR,163961,164161,don't worry about it yeah .
508,PAR,164161,164361,oof what causes stuttering ?
508,PAR,180915,189194,&-well I think it's definitely genetic because my dad has a stutter  .
508,PAR,189194,195487,&-um I confirmed that with him I wanna say maybe a year ago .
508,PAR,195487,201299,and so his &-um speech pattern is like mine .
508,PAR,201299,201499,&-um but it was hard for me to detect because he also didn't grow  up in the US .
508,PAR,201499,201699,he grew up in the Philippines .
508,PAR,201699,210293,and so English is a second language .
508,PAR,210293,219231,&-um but I could tell when he speaks his native tongue &-uh &+sh he  still shows &-like the same characteristics .
508,PAR,219231,220685,and so I [/] I definitely think it's that .
508,PAR,220685,220885,&-um and then for other people I've met where maybe if it doesn't  if they don't have any family lineage of stuttering .
508,PAR,220885,221085,I think it's definitely I mean like I don't work in the field I  guess I'm pretty conscious about the terminology I use but just  kinda like it is &-uh from what I can assess <it is> [/] it is a  disorder that the brain has that impacts everything else .
508,PAR,221085,221285,and so &-um after my lived experience I think of just &-uh waking  one day be there .
508,PAR,221285,221485,&-uh waking up one day and having stuttering be gone .
508,PAR,221485,265181,it kinda has it's [/] it's own timing and it's own pace that's not  dictated by anything that I can consciously do .
508,PAR,265181,265381,and so that's [/] that's why I think it's a brain disorder that  kinda it can just turn itself on and off &-um &-you_know &-like  &-like as I speak word by word .
508,PAR,265381,280500,but also on a macrolevel of having these stages of stuttering .
508,PAR,280500,280700,so I went to therapy twice .
508,PAR,280700,280900,&-um the first time when I was seven .
508,PAR,280900,281100,my mom actually tool me .
508,PAR,289925,300995,I didn't even know we went to therapy .
508,PAR,300995,301195,&-um so I don't remember but I remember my mom telling me about  that experience because &-uh the s@l l@l p@l talked to her  afterwards .
508,PAR,301195,301395,and she said that the s@l l@l p@l tried to &-uh play games with me  have me read books &-um have me point at things in the room and have  me tell them what they are .
508,PAR,301395,331333,basically anything &-um to get me talking in [/] in every single  way to get me talking in ever way just to see if she could detect a  pattern in like a certain activity .
508,PAR,331333,331533,and I was basically fluent in [/] in all of that so +...
508,PAR,331533,342582,and then when it my stuttering came back at thirteen I also went to  a speech therapist again .
508,PAR,342582,342782,&-um that one I do remember because I went into the speech  therapist's office she was asking me +//.
508,PAR,342782,355656,at that time I could actually tell her about my stuttering and how  it came back .
508,PAR,355656,355856,and so she again had me go through a series of things &-um .
508,PAR,355856,365959,went through it in a very organic way because I kinda forgot I was  seeing a speech therapist which was good &-um .
508,PAR,365959,366159,but again she had she did not detect anything &-um in any activity  .
508,PAR,366159,380668,although the only thing she said was when I was reading she told me  that at times I was reading too fast .
508,PAR,380668,392181,and it wasn't she didn't feel like it was because_of stuttering but  just &-um for some reason I was always just having a faster at  reading .
508,PAR,392181,392381,and so she had told me to slow down .
508,PAR,392381,392581,and I don't know if that was for speech or for what .
508,PAR,392581,400853,but that was the only feedback that I got from her .
508,PAR,400853,401053,&-um and so I think that like while it wasn't directed towards my  stuttering per say .
508,PAR,401053,415367,I feel like it did help me read more effectively &-like out loud .
508,PAR,415367,422079,just because I knew that I could trust in [/] in talking slower and  [/] and feeling comfortable with that .
508,PAR,422079,430713,&-uh cause often times I [/] I would feel like &-uh like if I  wasn't doing something fast enough it would be like <go faster go  faster> [/] go faster .
508,PAR,430713,430913,&-um maybe that was a [/] a product of I don't know the class I was  in or the environment I was raised in .
508,PAR,430913,431113,and so actually being able to told to slow down but maybe to slow  down to a normal place was [/] was extremely helpful .
508,PAR,431113,431313,&-uh you said effective communication right ?
508,PAR,453039,464782,successful communication .
508,PAR,464782,477839,&-um <I think> [/] I think communication is successful when [/]  when the two or multiple parties can comprehend each_other .
508,PAR,477839,478039,and so like if [/] if there's understanding with what's said no  matter how it's said .
508,PAR,478039,487503,I think that's good communication .
508,PAR,487503,499031,&-um and I say that growing up from a household where my parents  spoke a different first language than I did .
508,PAR,499031,499231,&-um you know it's definitely different speaking I think sometimes  like ninety percent of time I'm speaking to another person who  speaks Enlgish as their first language .
508,PAR,499231,517746,and so I've noticed that sometimes <I can> [/] I can even  communicate more effectively with my parents .
508,PAR,517746,522178,because_of the level or like the type of words that I know that  they'll understand .
508,PAR,522178,522378,versus maybe talking to someone who speaks English xxx and you're  like &-oh I need to use larger vocabulary or different sentence  structure or something different .
508,PAR,522378,540518,and so &-umum yeah I think successful communication can look very  different based on who you're talking to and what their background  is .
508,PAR,540518,540718,I would've gotten better grades I'll tell you that &-um just  because &-uh &-uh I was basically a straight a student until second  grade .
508,PAR,546053,560227,and then my &-um participation grade started to drop .
508,PAR,560227,560427,&-um just because I was more shy in the classroom .
508,PAR,560427,560627,&-um definitely had a_lot_of avoidance when it came to &-um  &-you_know raising my hand or participanting .
508,PAR,560627,560827,and [/] and when you look at you know the teachers curriculum at  the time it's like well &-uh you know a percentage of your class is  on test or homework or and then there's class participation .
508,PAR,560827,561027,and so &-you_know in my mind I was &-like hey &-like &-well an a@l  or &-well a b@l is like an eighty percent right ?
508,PAR,561027,561227,so if I get if I try to get over ninety percent on everything else  but this one thing maybe it won't be so bad .
508,PAR,561227,561427,but then &-um but then that also maybe without stuttering it  would've changed the pressure that was put on &-um by both myself  and my parents .
508,PAR,561427,608762,because then they were like why are you lacking in this .
508,PAR,608762,608962,and stuttering wasn't something to be talked about at home .
508,PAR,608962,618856,it was also something that &-um was meant to be &-uh corrected .
508,PAR,618856,619056,&-um so <I think> [/] I think there would've been pressure .
508,PAR,619056,619256,it would've been from another avenue .
508,PAR,619256,630944,but I think there was pressure on stuttering that &-you_know I  don't know what &+ave what those other avenues would've been .
508,PAR,630944,631144,&-um so there's that .
508,PAR,631144,643120,and then just socially I mean I probably would've had just a  different set of friends or maybe I would've &-uh branched out more  .
508,PAR,643120,650448,&-um I think stuttering definitely does have it's [/] it's role  there in kind of if you're not sure you're not gonna go talk to  someone .
508,PAR,650448,659319,&-um especially [/] especially in [/] in school where it's &-like  &-like &-like whatever you're presented with you think that's the  world .
508,PAR,659319,659519,and so &-you_know if you feel you can't even navigate through that  then it's easy to get down upon yourself .
508,PAR,659519,670131,it probably would've even helped with my self assurance my self  esteem .
508,PAR,670131,670331,&-um but &-you_know again &-you_know maybe that would've made  issues in other areas so yeah .
508,PAR,670331,670531,man I think for &-um students just &-uh &-you_know I [/] I went to  a workshop earlier talking about resiliency .
508,PAR,686514,702250,and &-um I think for students they're more resilient than you think  .
508,PAR,702250,712169,&-um &-you_know &-like we I guess even adults say life is a  rollercoaster and even school can be a rollercoaster .
508,PAR,712169,712369,and within that &-like stuttering can be a rollercoaster in [/] in  and of itself .
508,PAR,712369,718296,so there's gonna be good [/] good and bad moments with it .
508,PAR,718296,718496,&-um and definitely ask your parents to find or if you already have  it &-you_know find a support group or at least meet another person  who stutters .
508,PAR,718496,718696,to [/] to find [/] find your tribe .
508,PAR,718696,733735,find something in common .
508,PAR,733735,733935,&-um &-you_know everyone talks about therapy .
508,PAR,733935,741983,but therapy can be done on your own even outside the therapy room .
508,PAR,741983,744557,&-um &-you_know community is a big part of it .
508,PAR,744557,744757,&-um and I think that even extends out too to everyone else .
508,PAR,744757,755312,&-like &-um for parents for [/] for people who are not people who  stutter .
508,PAR,755312,755512,&-um &-you_know <if you're> [/] if you're in a room with a bunch of  people who stutter or if you're at conferences or workshops with  people who stutter .
508,PAR,755512,765387,&-like you're already doing more way more than the average person  does .
508,PAR,765387,769135,&-um and what [/] what was the last bit to that ?
508,PAR,769135,769335,&-oh yeah [/] yeah .
508,PAR,769335,769535,I mean that's really the best of just &-like I would guess &-like  maintaining your excitement .
508,PAR,769535,769735,because I feel like often times people will have good intentions  but &-um but you don't know what to do .
508,PAR,774202,792851,but I feel like step one meet people who stutter first .
508,PAR,792851,793051,step two go ahead and educate yourself at the workshops .
508,PAR,793051,793251,you know [/] know the terminology .
508,PAR,793251,800146,&-um know what people struggle with .
508,PAR,800146,800346,&-um three &-like never forget that yes &-like there are people who  stutter but they are more than just their stutter too .
508,PAR,800346,807740,like they are actual people .
508,PAR,807740,807940,and so &-um &-you_know maybe &-you_know obviously they're not gonna  be &-like used to someone who stutters .
508,PAR,807940,808140,but maybe someone who stutters is okay with who they are .
508,PAR,808140,821082,but <they need> [/] they need guidance or help in other areas .
508,PAR,821082,821282,&-um and then &-uh four is just knowing what your capacity is .
508,PAR,821282,827906,knowing what your skills are .
508,PAR,827906,828106,&-um maybe [/] maybe you're as social of a person so you're not  going to be up there wearing a t-shirt &-um like of a stuttering  core or anything stuttering related .
508,PAR,828106,828306,but maybe you have more behind the skills of helping I don't know .
508,PAR,828306,851066,maybe helping run &-like an office or a virtual office and helping  a [/] a stuttering organization run that way .
508,PAR,851066,851266,&-um but there's kinda &-like skill set and what you're comfortable  with .
508,PAR,851266,851466,&-so I feel like if you feel good with you're doing .
508,PAR,851466,858943,if you feel good with who whom you're working with .
508,PAR,858943,867014,&-um and you feel passionate about it then &-you_know I [/] I would  say that's problem the best way to help [/] help people who stutter  .
508,PAR,867014,875247,&-um it's no different then helping any other &-you_know struggle  or [/] or &+org or &-you_know what or what have you so .

508,INV,12625,12705,yeah .
508,INV,163161,171127,mhm .
508,INV,171127,171327,no it's fine .
508,INV,171327,180915,&-um what do you think causes stuttering ?

508,INV,280500,289925,&-um if you ever received treatment for your stuttering tell me  about your therapy experiences and the outcomes of these therapies .

508,INV,445265,453039,can you give an example of a positive communicative experience ?
508,INV,453039,453239,successful I think +/.
508,INV,540518,546053,&-um if you didn't stutter what &+m what might be different in your  life ?
508,INV,546053,546133,okay .
508,INV,670131,686514,&-um what else would you want to say to students or the general  public to help them learn about stuttering or ways to support people  who stutter ?
508,INV,769135,774202,&-um to help them learn about stuttering or ways to support people  who stutter .
509,PAR,13490,18700,sure so I'd say at this point in my life I'm thirty two stuttering  has a really positive impact .
509,PAR,18700,26861,I'm really involved with the National Stuttering Association &-um  branch in New York &-um the Manhattan chapter .
509,PAR,26861,31800,so I sometimes fill in and help with support groups I have a_lot_of  friends who stutter .
509,PAR,31800,39780,I wasn't always like this like as a child and a teenager I was not  really open about my stuttering I never had speech therapy until I  was a senior in high_school .
509,PAR,39780,45300,but as an adult &-um stuttering definitely positively informed my  life .
509,PAR,45300,50500,&-um after having really good speech therapy as a senior in  high_school I decided I wanted to become an SLP .
509,PAR,50500,55300,I went to undergrad and grad school and then got really involved  with the National Stuttering Association .
509,PAR,55300,57200,and now I'm at Friends .
509,PAR,57200,62000,I worked for two years at an organization called Say for kids and  teens who stutter .
509,PAR,62000,65223,and I would say overall stuttering has a really positive impact .
509,PAR,70478,80059,&-uh I would say it's a combination of genetics and environment and  the interaction between genetics and environment .
509,PAR,80059,86147,like my mom stutters my brother stutters she says that her father  stuttered so my grandfather .
509,PAR,86147,92724,&-um who passed away when I was two so can't confirm it but she  says he did and also apparently his father did .
509,PAR,92724,97000,so my great grandfather &-so and that's just on my mom's side of  the family .
509,PAR,97000,105100,and one of my cousins on my dad's side has a son who stutters who's  a teenager so &-um I feel like there's definitely a strong genetic  component .
509,PAR,105100,114000,also environmental factors &-um we also know that there are  differences in like the brains of people who stutter and the and  people who don't stutter .
509,PAR,114000,119450,so there's clearly some &-um you know neurological differences as  well .
509,PAR,130893,141931,so I actually only had speech therapy one time and it was senior I  was a senior in high_school it was pretty bad though I was at a  rough time in my life .
509,PAR,141931,154406,&-um related to stuttering &-um plus I went I knew I wanted to go  to college but I was really anxious about job interviews and didn't  know what kind of career I wanted to pursue and I felt like  stuttering was really holding me back .
509,PAR,154406,158850,so I decided on my own to &-uh &-um seek out a speech therapist .
509,PAR,158850,163300,and it was surprisingly difficult to find a speech therapist who  works with teenagers who stutter .
509,PAR,163300,175300,&-um a_lot_of them I contacted worked with like preschoolers which  didn't help me but I was very fortunate that I found a great SLP she  did a combination of like a_lot_of counciling acceptance like  desensitization work .
509,PAR,175300,180000,&-um with some I would say like fluency shaping and stuttering  modification .
509,PAR,180000,185650,like thrown in but &-like a big emphasis on it being okay to  stutter and stuttering openly as well .
509,PAR,192059,199408,&-um I wouldn't be at this conference I may not of become an SLP I  wouldn't know all these like amazing people who stutter .
509,PAR,199408,209873,&-um I don't know I don't think I [/] I wouldn't say that like my  relationship with my friends or family would have been any different  or more positive .
509,PAR,209873,217342,but I do think stuttering like greatly enhanced my life and  directed my career path so .
509,PAR,217342,219757,I would say that's something .
509,PAR,219757,222000,be positive it's a change .
509,PAR,232300,234000,&-uh really good question .
509,PAR,234000,252357,I think it's really important to know that stuttering is a lot more  than what you see or hear when someone's talking that there is that  whole &-um under the tip of the iceberg portion to stuttering and  also how variable stuttering is from like day to day or situation to  situation .
509,PAR,252357,262523,like I can I have some days where I don't stutter at all or barely  stutter at all and I have days or conversations where I may stutter  more than one time in one sentence .
509,PAR,262523,282137,and my stuttering may be struggled some days but also a lot easier  and looser other days so I think just knowing it's okay that  stuttering's variable and like as a speech therapist it doesn't mean  someone's doing more or less that your doing a bad job or good job  it just means that's like the nature of stuttering .
509,PAR,284000,285335,no problem .
509,INV,0,6900,alright so I'm going to ask you some questions the first one please  talk about the impact of stuttering on your daily life .
509,INV,6900,13490,you can talk about your interactions with family and friends school  and work or your participation in community activities .
509,INV,65223,70478,really good to hear second question is what do you think causes  stuttering ?
509,INV,119450,130893,mhm definitely yeah &-um next question is if you have &-uh received  any stuttering treatment can you tell me about your therapy  experiences and the outcome of these therapies ?
509,INV,185650,192059,mhm yeah alright &-uh next question is if you didn't stutter what  might be different in your life ?
509,INV,192059,192139,sure .
509,INV,222000,232300,&-uh last question is what else &-uh would you want to say to  students or the general public to help them learn about stuttering  or ways to support people who stutter ?
509,INV,282137,284000,yeah wow thank you for sharing .
44m,PAR,199,399,please talk about the impact of stuttering on your daily life .
44m,PAR,199,399,but I'm pretty sure that's normal .
44m,PAR,399,8086,you can talk about your interactions with family and friends .
44m,PAR,8086,9786,school and or work .
44m,PAR,9786,12752,and your participation xxx community activities .
44m,PAR,12752,12952,so I guess first off the thing about stuttering in my daily life .
44m,PAR,12952,18956,is I'm a very mild stutterer .
44m,PAR,18956,20876,so I don't really it doesn't really impact me too much .
44m,PAR,20876,23327,especially one thing about family and friends .
44m,PAR,23327,23527,I think that's usually an environment where I feel safe .
44m,PAR,23527,23727,and if it does occur it just occurs .
44m,PAR,23727,31581,I haven't really found a pattern about xxx .
44m,PAR,31581,36116,with school and work that's a little bit different where I just  completed my m@l b@l a@l .
44m,PAR,36116,40703,and one of the focuses of the program was to have a_lot_of  presentations .
44m,PAR,40703,44969,there's one two formal ones per class .
44m,PAR,44969,49120,and that was usually between twenty to forty five minutes long .
44m,PAR,49120,49320,so_that there was that .
44m,PAR,49320,49520,and so_that would be kind of +//.
44m,PAR,49520,49720,at the same time kind of scary frightening .
44m,PAR,49720,58093,but also the same time it was kind of exhilarating .
44m,PAR,58093,61287,because I don't like public speaking that much .
44m,PAR,61287,63496,but there was a xxx .
44m,PAR,63496,66115,so_that was kind of fun to do where you do it you feel great .
44m,PAR,66115,66315,I had an hour [/] hour let's say hour .
44m,PAR,66315,73735,a long presentation about Nascar .
44m,PAR,73735,75119,not a Nascar fan .
44m,PAR,75119,75319,learned a lot about it .
44m,PAR,75319,75519,it was kind of fun to xxx .
44m,PAR,75519,82652,just like okay be that kind of subject matter expert .
44m,PAR,82652,84622,so_that was kind of fun .
44m,PAR,84622,90025,but another thing that was very helpful with the program was also  very team based .
44m,PAR,90025,94511,my friends my team we were together for twenty seven months .
44m,PAR,94511,94711,that was kind of xxx there .
44m,PAR,94711,94911,so kind of +//.
44m,PAR,94911,95111,I was always speaking with groups .
44m,PAR,95111,101798,so_that seemed to help reduce some anxiety .
44m,PAR,101798,101998,the audience was the hard part .
44m,PAR,101998,105016,the my teammates was not .
44m,PAR,105016,111052,for work I don't think it's really impacted my life too much for  work .
44m,PAR,111052,111252,at this point and time in my career I'm just in office doing  paperwork .
44m,PAR,111252,116486,just kind of bureaucratic stuff .
44m,PAR,116486,116686,and so I interact primarily +//.
44m,PAR,116686,116886,I interact with vendors .
44m,PAR,116886,117086,I interact with internal departmental clients .
44m,PAR,117086,127777,xxx clients around my company .
44m,PAR,127777,127977,so it's kind of like I have that .
44m,PAR,127977,128177,so I guess I do interact with a_lot_of people .
44m,PAR,128177,138149,but I've been in the same place for over maybe twenty years .
44m,PAR,138149,138349,so it's kind of I know a_lot_of people .
44m,PAR,138349,142351,so it's kind of like there's not much stress there .
44m,PAR,142351,142551,there is some stuff with vendors .
44m,PAR,142551,149554,but I typically deal with the same ones again and again for  intercorporation@c stuff .
44m,PAR,149554,149754,like xxx i@l b@l m@l .
44m,PAR,149754,149954,it's just kind of +//.
44m,PAR,149954,154353,you get to know them .
44m,PAR,154353,154553,and some better than others .
44m,PAR,154553,157157,some of them I talk to weekly .
44m,PAR,157157,157357,some I talk to quarterly .
44m,PAR,157357,157557,so it's just kind of not really there .
44m,PAR,157557,161910,so it's not too bad .
44m,PAR,161910,166429,one thing I did do was for five years I did work at a call center .
44m,PAR,166429,175750,and so_that was xxx I can't really think my stuttering really  impacted me there .
44m,PAR,175750,175950,I do remember +//.
44m,PAR,175950,180786,it has been about ten years ago .
44m,PAR,180786,184954,and I was would have trouble in the morning .
44m,PAR,184954,187820,where I would say good morning .
44m,PAR,187820,188020,something like that some type of salutation .
44m,PAR,188020,188220,and the g@l would stop .
44m,PAR,188220,188420,and I feel like I don't know what it is .
44m,PAR,188420,188620,but I'm guessing some sort of a block .
44m,PAR,188620,196510,but it just good morning wouldn't come out .
44m,PAR,196510,196710,and it's just kind of +//.
44m,PAR,196710,205264,the people on the other line were probably thinking I'm doing  something like xxx to come in .
44m,PAR,205264,205464,but they really never knew .
44m,PAR,205464,205664,sometimes I would just hafta pause .
44m,PAR,205664,205864,and go that xxx .
44m,PAR,205864,206064,that's kind of weird .
44m,PAR,206064,213799,I can say good morning sometimes other times I can't do it .
44m,PAR,213799,215633,I don't know .
44m,PAR,215633,220103,participation in community activities ?
44m,PAR,220103,224320,don't really participate in that many community activities .
44m,PAR,224320,228718,honestly I'm kind of a shyer person .
44m,PAR,228718,233991,I can be extroverted can be introverted .
44m,PAR,233991,236643,kind of I don't really believe in Myers_Briggs xxx that much .
44m,PAR,236643,236843,but according to that I'm kind of half and half .
44m,PAR,236843,237043,so it's kind of dependent on my mood .
44m,PAR,237043,237243,I guess in the areas I do [/] do community activities .
44m,PAR,237243,247981,for a while at church at mass I was doing the first reading which  is the Old_Testament .
44m,PAR,247981,248181,and I kind of just did it just to get out there .
44m,PAR,248181,252083,and to kind of just do stuff .
44m,PAR,252083,252283,and really would have I don't think affected that much .
44m,PAR,252283,252483,xxx people xxx stutterer .
44m,PAR,252483,252683,but I always would have trouble with the Old_Testament names .
44m,PAR,252683,252883,the Hebrew names .
44m,PAR,252883,253083,(be)cause just reading them cold .
44m,PAR,253083,269026,and not really hearing them .
44m,PAR,269026,269226,I don't know the proper pronunciations so sometimes xxx okay .
44m,PAR,269226,275295,and it would probably just be slaughtered .
44m,PAR,275295,275495,I'm trying to think of +//.
44m,PAR,275495,275695,I've done Toastmasters .
44m,PAR,275695,275895,that was once again like I just try and throw myself out to a  environment where I hafta do public speaking .
44m,PAR,275895,276095,and it's gotten to the point where I know the Toastmasters club  very well so it's not really frightening anymore .
44m,PAR,276095,294704,it's just kind of like okay xxx go talk .
44m,PAR,294704,294904,and I guess when I get excited and start talking more it can kind  of make it come out more stuttered .
44m,PAR,294904,295104,I really haven't been keeping track so I really don't know .
44m,PAR,295104,311112,in my mind I stutter a fair amount .
44m,PAR,311112,311312,xxx impact my life that much .
44m,PAR,311312,315380,it's just kind of it's there .
44m,PAR,315380,315580,question number two .
44m,PAR,315580,321067,what do you think causes stuttering ?
44m,PAR,321067,321267,nice segue .
44m,PAR,321267,328004,I guess on a high level I would say in my personal estimation .
44m,PAR,328004,330487,I think there is a genetic component .
44m,PAR,330487,336353,that would allow people to have a higher propensity for stuttering  .
44m,PAR,336353,336553,but I'm also curious if there is a correlation between traumatic  brain injuries xxx concussions whatever you wanna call it .
44m,PAR,336553,336753,some kind of smacking the brain around .
44m,PAR,336753,353882,that will kind of activate that propensity or actually cause it .
44m,PAR,353882,354082,I don't know .
44m,PAR,354082,354282,I'm just that the reason why I have this kind of thinking is where  I work we have a groundskeeper .
44m,PAR,354282,354482,he's I know him pretty well .
44m,PAR,354482,354682,I said okay .
44m,PAR,354682,372189,xxx kind of bonded because_of the stuttering .
44m,PAR,372189,376243,he is a very heavy stutterer .
44m,PAR,376243,376443,he has had a lot +//.
44m,PAR,376443,380795,it impacts pretty much every sentence .
44m,PAR,380795,380995,or probably every second syllable or so .
44m,PAR,380995,383663,it's really [/] really bad .
44m,PAR,383663,383863,but he was a xxx in Vietnam .
44m,PAR,383863,384063,and knowing a fair amount about military history in Vietnam .
44m,PAR,384063,393334,I'm pretty sure he went through a_lot_of concussions .
44m,PAR,393334,393534,okay actually kind of go back to another thing .
44m,PAR,393534,393734,there were a_lot_of traumatic events .
44m,PAR,393734,404253,people died that were close to him .
44m,PAR,404253,404453,just kind of xxx .
44m,PAR,404453,404653,so I honestly think .
44m,PAR,404653,404853,before I get too xxx .
44m,PAR,404853,405053,that stuttering can also have a some type of +//.
44m,PAR,405053,405253,propensity genetic propensity then you have the anxiety emotional  outcome portion .
44m,PAR,405253,428283,and I think this because I didn't stutter until second grade first  grade .
44m,PAR,428283,429484,second or first grade .
44m,PAR,429484,440786,and there was my teacher who would keep me standing up class until  I could pronounce the words correctly or say something correctly .
44m,PAR,440786,444624,and I know before first grade I was going to speech therapy .
44m,PAR,444624,444824,and I don't know what it was .
44m,PAR,444824,444904,xxx .
44m,PAR,444904,452929,but the big day of success was when I could say mellow yellow .
44m,PAR,452929,453129,not sure what I was mispronouncing .
44m,PAR,453129,453329,but she would keep me +//.
44m,PAR,453329,453529,this teacher in first grade .
44m,PAR,453529,453609,crap .
44m,PAR,453609,453809,I think first grade .
44m,PAR,453809,464785,xxx .
44m,PAR,464785,464985,but it was like the teacher would keep me standing until I was in  tears and that would with that I started stuttering xxx .
44m,PAR,464985,465185,because I would just be forced xxx .
44m,PAR,465185,465385,and I'm assuming it was I don't know .
44m,PAR,465385,481092,I just know that my mother doesn't swear .
44m,PAR,481092,481292,and this is the one person I've heard her call a bitch .
44m,PAR,481292,488079,so I think with stuttering on the high level there's a genetic  component .
44m,PAR,488079,488279,right there's a gene .
44m,PAR,488279,494899,genetic component where people have the propensity for it .
44m,PAR,494899,501805,but I think there could be also brain injuries and also emotional  xxx .
44m,PAR,501805,502005,I think that's it .
44m,PAR,502005,502085,okay .
44m,PAR,502085,506521,question three .
44m,PAR,506521,506721,oh actually question two .
44m,PAR,506721,506921,oh one thing xxx more stuff .
44m,PAR,506921,507121,I'm a cat person .
44m,PAR,507121,507321,I have cats .
44m,PAR,507321,514789,I have a cat there .
44m,PAR,514789,514989,keeps me happy .
44m,PAR,514989,523163,when I'm at home I don't think I have any stuttering when I'm  dealing with cats .
44m,PAR,523163,525731,same thing with young children .
44m,PAR,525731,525811,singing ?
44m,PAR,525811,526011,I don't sing very well .
44m,PAR,526011,526211,so I won't say that one .
44m,PAR,526211,532385,I can carry a tune in a bucket .
44m,PAR,532385,532585,I'm very curious why with small children +//.
44m,PAR,532585,532785,usually three to five I'm really good with .
44m,PAR,532785,532985,<small ones> [/] small ones I don't really xxx .
44m,PAR,532985,533185,they scare the hell out_of me .
44m,PAR,533185,533265,xxx .
44m,PAR,533265,545690,I have no idea how to hold them .
44m,PAR,545690,545890,but small children and animals .
44m,PAR,545890,550757,I don't know xxx for the anxiety level .
44m,PAR,550757,550957,or if I have different tone .
44m,PAR,550957,551157,so I don't xxx .
44m,PAR,551157,551357,I'm not sure what xxx .
44m,PAR,551357,560148,if there is a cause .
44m,PAR,560148,560348,but so yeah .
44m,PAR,560348,564165,I think that's it for question two .
44m,PAR,564165,564365,question three .
44m,PAR,564365,573054,if you have received treatment for your stuttering tell me about  your therapy experiences and the outcome of your therapies .
44m,PAR,573054,573254,so as I said before I was in speech therapy in first grade .
44m,PAR,573254,573454,so I guess I started stuttering in second grade .
44m,PAR,573454,573654,and that was mellow yellow .
44m,PAR,573654,573854,oh crap was it kindergarten .
44m,PAR,573854,574054,okay early on .
44m,PAR,574054,574134,xxx .
44m,PAR,574134,588895,don't know what it is .
44m,PAR,588895,593263,and fourth through seventh grade I was in speech therapy .
44m,PAR,593263,593463,through elementary school and first year of junior high .
44m,PAR,593463,601985,and I remember we played Simon_Says .
44m,PAR,601985,602185,and that's about it .
44m,PAR,602185,602385,I remember getting into a debate with a teacher +//.
44m,PAR,602385,602585,I guess the therapist .
44m,PAR,602585,612622,about how pneumonia started with was spelled with an n@l not a p@l  and I was like I didn't know p@l was a word .
44m,PAR,612622,612822,so that's kind of like oh wow .
44m,PAR,612822,613022,xxx harder .
44m,PAR,613022,613222,oh also Thames .
44m,PAR,613222,613422,the xxx River was Thames .
44m,PAR,613422,613622,xxx had fun xxx that stuff .
44m,PAR,613622,613822,but actually therapy outcomes ?
44m,PAR,613822,625245,not really .
44m,PAR,625245,625250,no .
44m,PAR,625250,630030,I guess what I do know is what didn't happen .
44m,PAR,630030,630230,and this is more of the going back to question two .
44m,PAR,630230,630430,and the emotional impact .
44m,PAR,630430,642319,is fourth through fifth through sixth I was in elementary school  and I think that was a lot better controlled from the teachers .
44m,PAR,642319,644470,xxx I had xxx .
44m,PAR,644470,649272,but going to junior high I hadta do speech therapy during lunch  time .
44m,PAR,649272,649472,and I can't remember the exact thing but I remember that I went a  couple times .
44m,PAR,649472,649552,xxx .
44m,PAR,649552,649752,maybe once or twice .
44m,PAR,649752,657260,then I stopped going .
44m,PAR,657260,657460,and I think I was +//.
44m,PAR,657460,668430,I'm not sure if there was people making fun of me for going to  speech therapy at lunch time .
44m,PAR,668430,671499,asking like why are you going to that office the counselor's office  during lunch ?
44m,PAR,671499,673965,or it was just self conscious and I didn't wanna go .
44m,PAR,673965,675900,so I stopped going .
44m,PAR,675900,676100,in seventh grade .
44m,PAR,676100,676300,and xxx what happened I have no idea .
44m,PAR,676300,690454,that was before Desert_Storm so_that was long [/] long ago .
44m,PAR,690454,690534,so yeah .
44m,PAR,690534,690614,so +...
44m,PAR,690614,690694,yeah .
44m,PAR,690694,690894,so question four .
44m,PAR,690894,701047,please describe what successful communication means to you .
44m,PAR,701047,704230,can you give an example of a positive communicative experience ?
44m,PAR,704230,704430,what I believe successful communication is something that's very  hard to do .
44m,PAR,704430,704630,and it's because it's not dependent on one person .
44m,PAR,704630,723823,it's not just dependent on me .
44m,PAR,723823,727857,it's dependent on the speaker and the listener .
44m,PAR,727857,732092,and if you're both parties hafta do an act of communication .
44m,PAR,732092,732292,you need both people to listen .
44m,PAR,732292,732492,and listen to what people are saying .
44m,PAR,732492,738380,not what you're thinking they're saying .
44m,PAR,738380,743148,and in_order_to be successful you hafta be patient .
44m,PAR,743148,743348,and I think with this even though I stutter .
44m,PAR,743348,743548,it can come out kind of sloppy .
44m,PAR,743548,752670,compared to other people .
44m,PAR,752670,752870,xxx is fully intended .
44m,PAR,752870,753070,and even though that's there .
44m,PAR,753070,753270,if people are being a patient active listener they'll see the noise  come in .
44m,PAR,753270,767724,xxx .
44m,PAR,767724,767924,noise of +//.
44m,PAR,767924,768124,can't think of the analogy .
44m,PAR,768124,778683,there is the message and yet the kind of noise of the message  making things kind of complicated harder to understand .
44m,PAR,778683,783670,but if you're actually listening they'll be able to get the message  out from the noise .
44m,PAR,783670,785318,xxx what's going on .
44m,PAR,785318,785518,I think sometimes there's people .
44m,PAR,785518,792455,<one who thinks> [/] one who thinks right then .
44m,PAR,792455,796621,and just don't really care about the full aspect of what's going on  .
44m,PAR,796621,796821,so it's kind of like I think they already know the answer .
44m,PAR,796821,797021,ask the question .
44m,PAR,797021,797221,you start talking .
44m,PAR,797221,806662,and it's kind of you hear what you wanna hear .
44m,PAR,806662,806862,so I try not to do that .
44m,PAR,806862,807062,I probably still do that .
44m,PAR,807062,807262,but I guess I know in talking to family members .
44m,PAR,807262,807462,primarily my mother .
44m,PAR,807462,822319,xxx what I try and say and what she hears are two different things  .
44m,PAR,822319,832088,can I give a positive example of a communicative example ?
44m,PAR,832088,832168,xxx .
44m,PAR,832168,841744,can you give an example of a positive communicative experience ?
44m,PAR,841744,856985,I think my going through my m@l b@l a@l program and just kind of  having a presentation for every class .
44m,PAR,856985,857185,and like where you hafta get the students and just do that .
44m,PAR,857185,862486,<that was> [/] that was kind of fun .
44m,PAR,862486,862686,just was +//.
44m,PAR,862686,867189,if anything the program gave me more confidence that I can do stuff  .
44m,PAR,867189,867269,xxx .
44m,PAR,867269,874261,I kind of find it fun where xxx where everytime I practice I kind  of get a little better .
44m,PAR,874261,874461,but I still have +//.
44m,PAR,874461,874661,no matter how hard I practice .
44m,PAR,874661,878562,I would never have the same presentation every time .
44m,PAR,878562,889700,so I learned if I wanna do it I hafta have a very good knowledge  grasp of the you know of the subject matter .
44m,PAR,889700,889900,hafta be just know it by heart .
44m,PAR,889900,890100,and sometimes it's kind of hard .
44m,PAR,890100,890300,sometimes it's easier .
44m,PAR,890300,895087,if I like it .
44m,PAR,895087,895287,xxx kind of harder .
44m,PAR,895287,895487,some stuff is kind of confusing .
44m,PAR,895487,902090,xxx gotta really learn this stuff .
44m,PAR,902090,912896,I'm pretty sure everyone hates speaking .
44m,PAR,912896,913096,or I guess not everyone .
44m,PAR,913096,913296,xxx natural distribution of people .
44m,PAR,913296,920766,xxx hate xxx probably be in the middle somewhere .
44m,PAR,920766,920966,there's anxiety but it's just kind of +...
44m,PAR,920966,921166,I'm trying to think .
44m,PAR,921166,929971,I did do a best man speech for my best friend .
44m,PAR,929971,930171,it was like that was kind of scary but xxx everyone was drunk .
44m,PAR,930171,930371,and it was such an accepting audience that I could stutter every  three words and no one would care .
44m,PAR,930371,930571,I was just there as a best man .
44m,PAR,930571,950029,I was xxx friend's wedding .
44m,PAR,950029,954213,so it's not like I was the center of attention .
44m,PAR,954213,964837,so it's just kind of like I'm just there to be a little bit of  icing on the wedding cake for a metaphor .
44m,PAR,964837,965037,yeah so I think that's a positive .
44m,PAR,965037,965237,question five .
44m,PAR,965237,975890,if you didn't stutter what might be different in your life ?
44m,PAR,975890,979843,since my stutter is so mild .
44m,PAR,979843,983962,I don't think there is much there would be much different .
44m,PAR,983962,995070,<I think> [/] I think a xxx officially my stuttering is around  three percent .
44m,PAR,995070,995270,so it's just at the threshold of stuttering .
44m,PAR,995270,995470,so it's kind of not much different than the average person .
44m,PAR,995470,995670,and I don't think there'd be much different .
44m,PAR,995670,995750,oh crap !
44m,PAR,995750,995950,I forgot something .
44m,PAR,995950,1010222,going back to question three .
44m,PAR,1010222,1010422,I forgot to mention my parents .
44m,PAR,1010422,1010622,and my parents never asked me why I stopped going .
44m,PAR,1010622,1010822,they didn't acknowledge it xxx .
44m,PAR,1010822,1011022,and so I just know for the outcomes of the therapy I never learned  the confidence .
44m,PAR,1011022,1029885,or I had confidence I didn't have support .
44m,PAR,1029885,1030085,and so pretty much I think the term is covert stutterer .
44m,PAR,1030085,1036354,where you just kind of shut up and run silent run deep .
44m,PAR,1036354,1036554,so I think that happened .
44m,PAR,1036554,1041305,so it took me a while to get out_of my shell .
44m,PAR,1041305,1051460,and Iearn about who I am and how I can speak without being ashamed  of it .
44m,PAR,1051460,1051660,ashamed is not really a good word .
44m,PAR,1051660,1051860,I also feel like +//.
44m,PAR,1051860,1052060,that I guess the analogy is I xxx tell a story .
44m,PAR,1052060,1052140,xxx .
44m,PAR,1052140,1052340,there was a global trip and we went to Greece .
44m,PAR,1052340,1052540,but a couple of us from the class went to England beforehand .
44m,PAR,1052540,1073904,or rather London .
44m,PAR,1073904,1074104,and I kept on telling people like we were crossing streets  (be)cause different directions xxx big city .
44m,PAR,1074104,1074304,never be the lost zebra .
44m,PAR,1074304,1081924,never be the lost zebra .
44m,PAR,1081924,1082124,and I think I got that going back in my mind .
44m,PAR,1082124,1082324,where you haven't heard a zebra and the xxx .
44m,PAR,1082324,1082524,so xxx you can't really pick one out because they look the same .
44m,PAR,1082524,1082724,so maybe there's no problem with xxx .
44m,PAR,1082724,1082924,but you can have +//.
44m,PAR,1082924,1083124,once you have a difference xxx .
44m,PAR,1083124,1083324,and I remember being in like kindergarten ?
44m,PAR,1083324,1083524,it's been so long ago .
44m,PAR,1083524,1083724,I just remember someone from my school you stutter .
44m,PAR,1083724,1083804,oh nice .
44m,PAR,1083804,1121195,you're a bully .
44m,PAR,1121195,1121395,good for you .
44m,PAR,1121395,1121595,xxx your home life .
44m,PAR,1121595,1121795,so I remember that with me going to there I would be different and  so when I spoke I would be a stutterer and I'd be an outsider and  predators can always pick you up .
44m,PAR,1121795,1144055,and I remember in seventh grade we were reading a diary of  Anne_Frank in my class .
44m,PAR,1144055,1144135,and +//.
44m,PAR,1144135,1144215,English .
44m,PAR,1144215,1144415,and I remember I went to one thing where I wanna say xxx .
44m,PAR,1144415,1144495,xxx .
44m,PAR,1144495,1153093,but I always liked the German language .
44m,PAR,1153093,1153293,and it's just kind of +//.
44m,PAR,1153293,1153493,that's the one thing I would say .
44m,PAR,1153493,1153693,like I xxx .
44m,PAR,1153693,1161529,and xxx they didn't force me to until I was in high school .
44m,PAR,1161529,1161729,and I respect that .
44m,PAR,1161729,1161929,but it's just kind of having a thing where +//.
44m,PAR,1161929,1162129,it might have been eighth grade .
44m,PAR,1162129,1162329,xxx so long I can't remember .
44m,PAR,1162329,1175254,but it's just kind of never getting the support from my parents .
44m,PAR,1175254,1175454,confidence to do things where I could potentially make an ass of  myself .
44m,PAR,1175454,1183291,and not realize if I did make an ass of myself I would be protected  from xxx .
44m,PAR,1183291,1183491,or just people making snide comments .
44m,PAR,1183491,1183691,sorry about that .
44m,PAR,1183691,1190024,xxx .
44m,PAR,1190024,1190224,so question five .
44m,PAR,1190224,1190424,if you didn't stutter what might be different in your life .
44m,PAR,1190424,1190624,I guess I might have been more confident in different things in my  life .
44m,PAR,1190624,1190824,I kind of thought +//.
44m,PAR,1190824,1191024,I never was in the military .
44m,PAR,1191024,1210105,kind of wanted to be since I was a kid .
44m,PAR,1210105,1210305,and I was kind of curious xxx in the military if one had a stutter  .
44m,PAR,1210305,1210505,and I never really explored that xxx .
44m,PAR,1210505,1210705,like I mentioned in three a@l .
44m,PAR,1210705,1210905,I didn't have much confidence .
44m,PAR,1210905,1222490,so I was kind of there so .
44m,PAR,1222490,1222690,but that might be good because it would have probably been in the  early two thousands .
44m,PAR,1222690,1236115,so it might have been a completely different world now if I was in  the military in <two thousand> [/] two thousand one .
44m,PAR,1236115,1236315,maybe it's good I didn't do that .
44m,PAR,1236315,1239967,so .
44m,PAR,1239967,1240167,xxx my life .
44m,PAR,1240167,1240367,I don't think that much different .
44m,PAR,1240367,1240567,so question six .
44m,PAR,1240567,1254186,what else would you wanna say to students or the general public to  help them learn about stuttering or ways to support people who  stutter .
44m,PAR,1254186,1288287,okay first of all to students one thing is when interacting with  people who stutter yes you have the issue of treating I guess the  stutter the fluency I'm not sure the correct term but do not forget  the emotional content [/] content compact I forget the friggin@c  word .
44m,PAR,1288287,1290657,emotional impact of stuttering .
44m,PAR,1290657,1293354,emotional component of stuttering .
44m,PAR,1293354,1293554,emotional component .
44m,PAR,1293554,1293754,and how that is you have the communication xxx .
44m,PAR,1293754,1306765,I would say that's as important as the actual speaking .
44m,PAR,1306765,1306965,xxx helps for that .
44m,PAR,1306965,1312602,and sometimes maybe just talk see how they're feeling .
44m,PAR,1312602,1312802,my parents never really +//.
44m,PAR,1312802,1313002,I never saw them .
44m,PAR,1313002,1313202,they xxx once .
44m,PAR,1313202,1313402,so it was never really demonstrative .
44m,PAR,1313402,1326959,but it was also a childhood that was very isolated .
44m,PAR,1326959,1327159,because no one was asking how I was feeling .

27ma,PAR,11567,17531,the impact is pretty huge &-um .
27ma,PAR,17531,42856,if you ask my friends or family or just people I hang out with they  may not think so because you_know I'm participating I'm talking I'm  social I'm making jokes &-um so it all seems pretty okay but it's  still only a fraction of what I would give or present if I didn't  stutter .
27ma,PAR,42856,43056,&-um and because stuttering is so variable which is personally my  biggest &-uh source of frustration with it .
27ma,PAR,43056,43256,it's frustrating because sometimes you meet someone and you_know  you're able to show a_lot_of yourself and it's great and other times  you're meeting someone you're interested in and you_know you can't  show anything .
27ma,PAR,43256,79562,you can't show your personality you're blocked up .
27ma,PAR,79562,79762,so &-um I'll be honest I &-uh forgot the question but something  about impact <of &-uh> [//] on life .
27ma,PAR,79762,110212,there's a big impact <and it is> [//] and <it's hard to see if you  don't understand &-um> [//] it's hard to see if you don't understand  the underlying or core learning of stuttering .
27ma,PAR,110212,115793,which extends far beyond just having trouble getting your words out  .
27ma,PAR,119736,128526,&-um well I don't think we know &-um I think there's definitely a  genetic component to it .
27ma,PAR,128526,137151,as far as I understand there's a miscommunication in the brain &-um  .
27ma,PAR,137151,163872,I think the main culprit is Broca's area and &-um there's another  one <which deals with &-um> [//] that deals with speech timing in  terms of the &-uh mechanical &-um formation of it but xxx they  interact it's mainly Broca's area .
27ma,PAR,163872,174383,&-um and on top of that &-uh environmental factors I think play a  huge role but it's hard to know how much .
27ma,PAR,174383,186291,just seeing as how speech is such an individual thing you clearly  hafta take a large sample size to be able to even attempt to reach  any kind of conclusion so .
27ma,PAR,186291,216440,&-um the analogy I've heard that I like as far as &-um you_know how  likely are you to stutter or what not is genetics loads the gun but  environment pulls the trigger .
27ma,PAR,216440,216640,so maybe you &-uh have <a strong> [//] a stronger genetic  predisposition but growing up you grew up you_know very independent  and had a_lot_of positive reinforcement .
27ma,PAR,216640,245532,&-um it may not be such a big deal for you whereas you_know you  would have had a lower genetic predisposition .
27ma,PAR,245532,253068,for it and just a really tough environment and &-uh it triggered  much stronger in you .
27ma,PAR,253068,253268,&-uh sure I'll try to keep this one short .
27ma,PAR,261240,272170,&-um yeah I've had therapy pretty much all my life I probably saw  like around five therapists &-um .
27ma,PAR,272170,285540,by the time I was twenty or something and &-uh yeah all of those  therapies revolved around some form of fluency shaping in one way or  another .
27ma,PAR,285540,311608,&-um I don't wanna completely trash &-uh fluency shaping because I  have met people who's &-uh primary goal was to be able to speak  fluently and learning the techniques you_know gave them what they  were looking for and they practiced and worked very hard and yeah  they were able to speak fluent and they were happy and it was great  .
27ma,PAR,311608,323863,&-um for me the issue isn't fluency or not fluency it's how I feel  and particulary how I feel about myself in regards to my stutter so  &-um .
27ma,PAR,323863,382399,&-um I xxx fluency shaping and when I was older I went out to an  intensive &-uh three week program and when I was there it was all  great because I was in this &-um safe kind of isolated environment  learning these techniques during the day and trying to come out in  the evenings you_know out in the world but it was also very  contained and then you come home &-um and you practice like you're  sposta or at least as best as you can with everything else going on  but you_know slowly but surely for almost everyone it falls apart  and then you blame yourself because the techniques worked there so  obviously the problem is you .
27ma,PAR,382399,386108,which isn't &-uh true that's a fallacy &-um .
27ma,PAR,386108,396402,I found a different approach that &-uh doesn't focus on fluency at  all .
27ma,PAR,396402,407115,&-um stuttering isn't an issue here the issue is the struggle .
27ma,PAR,407115,413064,&-um that's what actually causes the problems and the pain and the  anguish and all that stuff .
27ma,PAR,413064,413264,&-um I mean if you wanna talk about frequency just to give you an  example .
27ma,PAR,413264,413464,I can speak like this and it's really fine but the frequency is  almost every other word or even more but you have no problem  understanding me .
27ma,PAR,413464,435075,I can change tone and pitch and it's not a big deal .
27ma,PAR,435075,446552,or I can block on you_know one sound a sentence but if it's an  intense block that's more of an interruption in communication and  making connections and anything so &-um .
27ma,PAR,446552,451950,as far as I'm concerned it's &-uh struggle not fluency .
27ma,PAR,451950,453855,is the way to go .
27ma,PAR,453855,454055,&-um yeah I may split this up in two parts .
27ma,PAR,463498,489834,one <I think the there &-um well xxx> [//] I think the core  component of successful communication is that you're saying  everything you wanna say and you aren't holding yourself back .
27ma,PAR,489834,490034,for me personally it's that I'm expressing myself as I wanna and as  I'm able to &-um .
27ma,PAR,490034,516507,I don't do a_lot_of word substitution but sometimes I'm not able to  say things the way I wanna or in the tone or the cadence or with a  certain kind of personality &-um .
27ma,PAR,516507,551068,<so_that isn't too success> [//] so that's only partially  successful because I'm saying everything I wanna say but to really  be successful is for me to able to &-um stutter and have as many  disfluencies as I just end up having and not really let it affect  and still feel like I can kind of control how it comes out &-um even  if it takes longer to do so .
27ma,PAR,556293,571015,&-um I wanna say everything but I don't feel like it would be  everything in terms of actual things I feel like it would be  everything in terms of intensity .
27ma,PAR,571015,571215,I would just be able to express myself more .
27ma,PAR,571215,586690,I'd probably be able to enjoy life more and have a much stronger  zest for it &-um .
27ma,PAR,586690,599943,I would free up a_lot_of mental and physical energy too that I  don't hafta devote to speaking &-um .
27ma,PAR,599943,620848,before I would probably devote like you_know eighty to ninety  percent if not one hundred percent of mental energy &-um during  conversation just on trying to get my words out .
27ma,PAR,620848,636756,that doesn't give a lot left &-um to be in the moment or &-uh  connect with the other person or just enjoy the interaction .
27ma,PAR,636756,652598,&-um so I feel like a lot would change but it would only be in the  intensity but I feel that's a pretty big thing .
27ma,PAR,652598,652798,&-um this is a tough one this is a hard one .
27ma,PAR,661322,698338,I can say the &-uh listeners that I enjoy &-uh most and I'm just  talking about &-um &-uh random strangers .
27ma,PAR,698338,698538,I talk to they're the people who just don't care .
27ma,PAR,698538,698738,and when I say don't care they aren't interested in the fact that  you are stuttering or you might be struggling or just total you_know  xxx because a_lot_of times I meet people you_know who you_know see  &-um me struggling and they empathize with that .
27ma,PAR,698738,757246,so they might put in you_know extra effort into listening or be  extra attentive to everything I'm saying &-um which on the one hand  is nice on the other hand depending on the person it can put extra  pressure on them .
27ma,PAR,757246,757446,&-um but I really enjoy the people who just don't care .
27ma,PAR,757446,770080,like I can be having a monster of a time just stuck and they're  just like you_know it's alright take your time you'll say it  whenever you say it .
27ma,PAR,770080,784017,and it's such a rare thing it actually kind of confuses me like  woah I'm not useta someone being so okay with this <it's &-um> [//]  it kind of throws me off .
27ma,PAR,784017,807113,but those are great &-um opportunities for me to reflect back to  myself and be like yeah it isn't a big deal it may suck or take me  longer to say but obviously it's not something I can control so  you_know just you_know make the best of it .
27ma,INV,199,11567,you can talk about your interactions with family and friends school  and or work and your participation in community activities .
27ma,INV,115793,119736,what do you think causes stuttering ?
27ma,INV,253068,261240,if you have received treatment for your stuttering tell me about  your therapy experiences and the outcomes of these therapies .
27ma,INV,453855,463498,please describe what successful communication means to you and can  you give an example of a positive communicative experience ?

62m,PAR,291617,291817,like a_lot_of people who stutter .
62m,PAR,291817,299194,and we don't have children .
62m,PAR,299194,299394,and in that list of reasons we don't have children .
62m,PAR,299394,306176,one of those is that I wouldn't wanna have a child that stutters .
62m,PAR,306176,306376,I would say &-um to look +//.
62m,PAR,314981,324800,&-uh first of all find other people who stutter .
62m,PAR,324800,325000,find the groups .
62m,PAR,325000,325200,like n@l s@l a@l .

62m,PAR,325400,332626,<I would> [//] I've never [/] never been around people who stutter  .
62m,PAR,332626,333969,until I found out about n@l s@l a@l .
62m,PAR,333969,334169,and even in my work experience .
62m,PAR,334169,334369,the last several years .
62m,PAR,334369,334569,because +//.
62m,PAR,334569,339828,and I wasn't active in the n@l s@l a@l .

62m,PAR,351147,351347,and management leadership .
62m,PAR,351347,356782,and so few people understand about stuttering .
62m,PAR,356782,359982,so it's [/] it's [/] it's [/] it's good to [/] to [/] to know that  you're not alone .
62m,PAR,359982,360182,I know that [/] that sounds trite and corny .
62m,PAR,360182,360382,but that really is .
62m,PAR,360382,360582,and then also to learn for me as being an engineer .
62m,PAR,360582,360782,to have an in depth understanding .
62m,PAR,360782,374061,that knowledge somehow makes me &-uh accepted more .

62m,INV,10563,12601,and or work .
62m,INV,12601,16729,and your participation in community activities .
62m,INV,73886,80219,what do you think causes stuttering ?
62m,INV,80219,80419,if you have received treatment for your stuttering .
62m,INV,80419,80619,tell me about your therapy experiences .
62m,INV,112780,123712,and the outcomes of these therapies .
62m,INV,190420,196856,please describe what successful communication means to you .
62m,INV,196856,200823,and can you give an example of a positive communication experience  ?
62m,INV,268875,274659,if you didn't stutter what might be different in your life ?
62m,INV,274659,274859,what else would you wanna say to students or the general public .
62m,INV,306176,314981,to help them learn about stuttering .
62m,INV,314981,315181,or ways to support people who stutter .
46mb,PAR,25592,33126,so let's see <I don't think> [/] I don't think stuttering really  impacts my [/] my activities in community service I mean I'm a  chapter leader here .
46mb,PAR,33126,39772,&-um as far as friends none [/] none of my close friends ever  judged me because_of my stuttering .
46mb,PAR,39772,39972,&-um I think as a kid it was hard .
46mb,PAR,39972,45151,I was bullied I was made fun of .
46mb,PAR,45151,45351,&-um but then in high_school I took some speech therapy so I got  better .
46mb,PAR,45351,52285,&-um .
46mb,PAR,52285,60517,I think going for jobs I was nervous so sometimes it might have  hindered [/] hindered me from getting the next job I wanted .
46mb,PAR,60517,66146,but now that I've developed more confidence in my career and my  abilities I don't think it hinders me .
46mb,PAR,66146,73128,so I don't think it really impacts my daily life as much as [/] as  much it did say thirty years ago or twenty five years ago .
46mb,PAR,73128,79976,it did prevent me from dating a lot but I'm married now so I guess  I don't hafta worry about that now .
46mb,PAR,79976,80176,what do I think causes stuttering ?
46mb,PAR,88996,95459,&-uh well <I'm not> [/] I'm not an SLP like other people I know .
46mb,PAR,95459,110156,so I just think something genetics &-um something with the vocal  cords general neurological and I just think if you get more nervous  &-uh whatever happens I think tenses up .
46mb,PAR,110156,113682,and it causes you to &-uh stutter .
46mb,PAR,113682,121970,and <the more> [/] the more you get nervous the more you try to  fight the blocking the more it gets worse so it's like this circular  reference .
46mb,PAR,121970,122170,as a kid I took I had a speech therapist come to my house and I  hated it .
46mb,PAR,139175,152651,I hated being different I did all the exercises the night before  and she kinda knew it and I really hated how I sound .
46mb,PAR,152651,158128,and then in high_school I wanted to do something different and I  wanted to change myself .
46mb,PAR,158128,165276,so I met a speech therapist in high_school and I just basically  every day I ate lunch with her .
46mb,PAR,165276,165476,and practice breathing practice reading out loud .
46mb,PAR,165476,173512,talking more in the classroom getting up to speak more .
46mb,PAR,173512,177035,and I guess she kind of changed my life .
46mb,PAR,177035,177235,so I had positive experiences with it .
46mb,PAR,177235,185453,if you ask me what program it was I can't tell you I don't remember  .
46mb,PAR,212043,219311,&-um I think for a person who stutters I think speaking in front of  other people is a positive experience .
46mb,PAR,219311,227195,I think if you can overcome your fear and anxiety of getting up in  front of a crowd if you stutter so what .
46mb,PAR,227195,236530,so I think that's all positive and that's what I would view as a  positive experience I think the key is just getting out_of your  comfort zone .
46mb,PAR,247587,263221,well I would say not stuttering at all but I just think if you get  up in a crowd I just think getting and talking in front of other  people I think is the most important thing and I would say that's  the biggest success factor .
46mb,PAR,277017,287369,you know I would probably maybe I would have friends that I wanted  to have as a kid that I didn't have .
46mb,PAR,287369,290913,but then I'm not sure I would be the person I am today .
46mb,PAR,290913,291113,so am I happy I stutter ?
46mb,PAR,291113,300232,"no, but I think all in all I think that's kind of me so that's a  part of me ."
46mb,PAR,323534,329595,&-um I think supporting people who stutter just don't finish  sentences for them .
46mb,PAR,329595,334776,unless they ask &-um let them speak no matter how long it takes .
46mb,PAR,334776,334976,&-um don't laugh don't judge &-um .
46mb,PAR,334976,335176,and I think the biggest thing is just encourage people who stutter  just to be themselves go up and speak in public .
46mb,PAR,335176,335376,you can be a doctor you can be an accountant you can be a lawyer .
46mb,PAR,335376,362935,you could be whatever you wanna be don't let anything stop you from  being whatever you wanna be .
46mb,PAR,362935,363135,&-um I don't think so okay .
46mb,PAR,363135,381631,you're welcome .
46mb,INV,79,279,talk about the impact stuttering has on your daily life .
46mb,INV,279,25592,you can talk about your interactions with family and friends school  and or work and your participation in community activities .
46mb,INV,79976,88996,okay &-uh what do you think causes stuttering ?
46mb,INV,121970,139175,if you have received treatment for your stuttering tell me about  your therapy experiences and the outcomes of these therapies .
46mb,INV,185453,212043,please describe what successful communication means to you and can  you give an example of a positive communicative experience ?
46mb,INV,236530,247587,okay and anything else you wanna add about what successful  communication means to you ?
46mb,INV,263221,277017,"if you didn't stutter, what might be different in your life ?"
46mb,INV,300232,323534,what else would you wanna say to students or the general public to  help them learn about stuttering or about ways to support people who  stutter ?
46mb,INV,323534,323734,is there anything else you'd like for others to know about  stuttering ?
46mb,INV,323734,323934,thank you .
54m,PAR,17238,20421,wow that's a hard question .
54m,PAR,20421,28743,so &-um I've been a stutterer since you_know I could first speak .
54m,PAR,28743,41126,&-um so it's impacted &-uh &-uh &-uh my life in you_know very  positive and probably also &-uh somewhat negative ways .
54m,PAR,41126,52906,at this point as a thirty eight year old it's &-uh very different  than it was when I was sixteen seventeen .
54m,PAR,52906,53106,&-um right now at this point &-uh you_know I still think about my  stuttering a lot particulary &-uh there at work .
54m,PAR,53106,68283,&-um you_know <there are certainly times> [//] I mean the company  that I work for people know that I stutter obviously .
54m,PAR,68283,68483,&-um so it's not something that I hide and it's not something that  I try to hide .
54m,PAR,68483,81300,but I guess <I always> [/] I always do wish that I could be &-uh  more fluent &-uh than what I am .
54m,PAR,81300,81500,&-um my interactions with family and friends ?
54m,PAR,81500,81700,you_know it's really interesting sometimes I feel like I stutter  more &-uh with my family .
54m,PAR,81700,81900,&-um and sometimes with my friends as well particulary friends that  I haven't seen for awhile but that I you_know have a very close  relationship with .
54m,PAR,81900,82100,it's like I always feel like I'm kind of like &-uh reintroducing  &-uh my stuttering to them even though it's clear that &-uh they've  always known me as a stutterer .
54m,PAR,82100,115791,<so it's &-uh> [//] there's some mind games there &-uh I think that  happen .
54m,PAR,115791,129696,&-um I think sometimes I still get &-uh more hesitant to kind of  put myself out there in certain social situations with people &-uh  who I don't know .
54m,PAR,129696,143281,but I'm you_know I'm a fairly like an outgoing person so I try not  to let it get in my way but I can see that there you_know are  certain times where it still probably does .
54m,PAR,143281,143481,oh I don't know .
54m,PAR,143481,143681,&-um you_know <I've been reading about> [//] I've read quite a bit  about stuttering &-uh when I was younger .
54m,PAR,149448,163451,I haven't read anything about it for a while .
54m,PAR,163451,163651,so the research has probably &-uh been updated since .
54m,PAR,163651,178321,but I personally think that <it's> [//] there's a emotional aspect  to it and there's a psychological aspect to it .
54m,PAR,178321,178521,&-um I feel like if I give myself the time and the space to kind of  practice you_know techniques &-uh easy onsets the &-uh breathing and  such that &-uh that physically something happens and fluent speech  can be created .
54m,PAR,178521,211731,but I think being able to do that spontaneously is really [/]  really difficult .
54m,PAR,211731,211931,I feel like probably &-uh the reason for that is [/] is that  there's other &-uh psychological things that are happening &-uh with  your speech .
54m,PAR,211931,212131,and you_know I think that goes back to what I said for the first  answer which was you_know oh why do I seem to stutter more with  people you_know who I love and who love me you_know .
54m,PAR,212131,242130,that just doesn't really make sense .
54m,PAR,242130,253626,unless there's you_know there's other things that are going on &-uh  well beyond kind of the physical &-uh manifestation of fluent speech  .
54m,PAR,253626,253826,so my mom started taking me to speech therapy when I was very young  probably six seven eight let's say .
54m,PAR,253826,254026,I remember going a little bit xxx high school .
54m,PAR,254026,254226,&-um I went to a very good therapist .
54m,PAR,254226,254426,she wasn't a specialist in stuttering even though she really cared  and I think that she did a_lot_of kind of &-um her own research to  try to like figure it out .
54m,PAR,263735,296088,so I you_know I felt like I was in a really safe place with her .
54m,PAR,296088,314273,&-um and you_know there were times where we would be within the  sessions and you_know things would start to &-uh to sound more  fluent but you_know it never &-uh was a cure all .
54m,PAR,314273,314473,I can honestly say that I was never the best in taking the lessons  &-um from the classroom into my daily life .
54m,PAR,314473,342328,I was kind of you_know like a hard headed kid and you_know I was a  boy and <I just> [//] you_know it was always something that I felt  like that my mom was taking me to and not really something that I  was internalizing xxx at that age .
54m,PAR,342328,342528,and then &-um when I gotta college I never went to speech therapy  though one year probably &-uh like my junior year I got so  frustrated with my speech that I went to the speech and language  department at my university and you_know tried to find you_know some  help or some support or something .
54m,PAR,342528,342728,and they weren't really able to give me &-uh very much support .
54m,PAR,342728,342928,and they certainly didn't point me towards the n@l s@l a@l .
54m,PAR,342928,386030,I doubt that there was one on campus or anything like that .
54m,PAR,386030,386230,and then you_know I was able to get over that .
54m,PAR,386230,393785,and then I went to the Peace_Corps .
54m,PAR,393785,393985,and in about my second year of that I got so frustrated again with  my speech that I went to &-uh the Hollins_Fluency_Center or  something .
54m,PAR,393985,407136,I don't even know what it is .
54m,PAR,407136,416076,<it's like an> [//] it's &-uh like a non-governmental association  of some sort that's in &-uh Hollins Virginia .
54m,PAR,416076,432823,a really good program and I feel like that you_know like again if  you're looking only at kind of the physical &-uh manifestation of  stuttering I think that those guys do a really good job .
54m,PAR,432823,460166,but again I think you_know some of my old habits &-um came back  into play a little bit and I you_know I wouldn't continue with the  techniques quite as much and there was always this other &-uh  emotional response that wasn't really ever dealt with .
54m,PAR,460166,467581,and so essentially you_know I'm back to kind of <where I> [//] &-uh  where I've always been you_know .
54m,PAR,467581,477658,now this n@l s@l a@l thing I'm back to where I've always been but  like it doesn't feel quite so lonely I guess .
54m,PAR,477658,498358,so that's a good thing so I you_know I feel like even though I'm  not going to a formal speech therapy I'm starting to think about and  to emotionally deal with some of the other things that I've never  gotten out_of speech therapy .
54m,PAR,498358,500401,and that's been &-uh through the n@l s@l a@l .
54m,PAR,500401,500601,you_know it's interesting I've gotten &-uh feedback &-uh very often  from my peers and &-uh from my supervisors that I'm a very effective  &-uh communicator even though I don't see myself as one because I'm  always like how can you be stutterer and still &-uh be an effective  &-uh communicator .
54m,PAR,500601,500801,but I think that I am actually somehow some way .
54m,PAR,516211,549715,it's like a mysterious thing to me actually .
54m,PAR,549715,549915,&-uh but like what does it mean .
54m,PAR,549915,561950,I mean you_know I think it just means a@l to be able to relate to  the audience or to the person &-uh that you're talking to .
54m,PAR,561950,564490,and b@l to be able to get your message across .
54m,PAR,564490,568600,and you_know communication is a two way street .
54m,PAR,568600,568800,so it's being a good listener is as important as being a good  talker .
54m,PAR,568800,585930,and so I think that I've probably gotten pretty good at &-uh the  listener part .
54m,PAR,585930,590743,and perhaps that's why people appreciate &-uh the way that I  communicate with them .
54m,PAR,590743,595003,I don't know .
54m,PAR,595003,595203,an example of effective &-uh communication .
54m,PAR,595203,595403,that one's difficult .
54m,PAR,595403,606753,that one's difficult .
54m,PAR,606753,606953,I hafta give a_lot_of presentations at work .
54m,PAR,606953,615213,I spend a_lot_of time on Skype on the phone .
54m,PAR,615213,617198,a_lot_of conference calls .
54m,PAR,617198,623196,sometimes I'm asked to sit on you_know &-uh panels and things &-uh  there at conferences .
54m,PAR,623196,631435,and it's challenging &-um .
54m,PAR,631435,640676,if I'm with like an audience that doesn't know me I will often  times advertise my stutter .
54m,PAR,640676,645873,because I think that it calms &-uh my anxiety .
54m,PAR,645873,658211,if I'm with people you_know from work who really know me well I  usually just &-uh push on and talk about the same way that I'm  talking right now .
54m,PAR,658211,658411,&-um and again like for whatever reason it seems to be effective .
54m,PAR,658411,666663,I don't really know why .
54m,PAR,666663,666863,quite a bit .
54m,PAR,666863,667063,<I mean I've always had the internal> [//] you_know the voice of  self for me is pretty high on the adjectives that I would use to  describe myself would be &-uh that I'm a stutterer .
54m,PAR,673485,695556,so that's kind of part of who I am .
54m,PAR,695556,698246,and it's part of the world &-uh that I live in .
54m,PAR,698246,705833,so I would be a very different person .
54m,PAR,705833,706033,&-uh yeah I mean you_know I think it's made me more empathetic &-uh  more sympathetic &-um and &-uh like I said earlier probably &-uh  like a better listener .
54m,PAR,706033,729413,because I'm really not the one that always wants to kind of  you_know put his opinion you_know really first .
54m,PAR,729413,743236,you_know sometimes that's &-um been a detriment but I think on the  whole &-um it's you_know probably made me a better person .
54m,PAR,754496,763303,hm: I don't know .
54m,PAR,763303,763503,&-um you_know I would say &-uh learn about the n@l s@l a@l .
54m,PAR,763503,777643,you_know try you_know if you're curious you_know there's a_lot_of  resources out there and it's not such a mysterious thing .
54m,PAR,777643,790125,&-um and that even for me as someone who stuttered took until &-uh  like a year and a half ago when I came to this very building and  came to the first meeting .
54m,PAR,790125,809828,so you_know &-um there's a lot out there it's not some you_know  &-uh closet thing that only you_know a very few of us in this world  hafta deal with but it's fairly common .
54m,PAR,809828,828578,and &-um I think that we both needta give ourselves a break &-uh  because I think that people who stutter are probably harder on  themselves than you_know some other folks who are you_know probably  dealing with things that are &-uh very similar .
54m,PAR,828578,833525,but not as clearly obvious to the outside world .
54m,PAR,833525,841730,&-um and I think that the world would &-uh do better to learn more  about us .
54m,PAR,841730,846426,&-uh because it's still &-uh very much a mystery .
54m,PAR,846426,873515,and so for anyone who's curious and &-um who thinks that this is  something which is interesting for them either professionally or  just out_of curiosity I would encourage you to you_know to find  you_know all of the resources that are freely available and to find  your local n@l s@l a@l chapter &-um to find out more .

35mb,PAR,62748,62948,and you know it was [/] was really bad .
35mb,PAR,62948,63148,and &-uh around that time I began to spend more and more time just  me .
35mb,PAR,63148,77738,and I gotta a point where like therapy hadn't worked .
35mb,PAR,77738,80271,you know and I was kind of over it .
35mb,PAR,80271,85511,and I knew that something had [/] hadta change .
35mb,PAR,85511,85711,because this <wasn't> [//] didn't seem to be going anywhere .
35mb,PAR,85711,85911,so I kind of hadta you know figure it out .
35mb,PAR,85911,99233,and through all of that .
35mb,PAR,99233,105204,I was able to come to terms with it .
35mb,PAR,105204,105404,and you know I [/] I can't change it .
35mb,PAR,105404,105604,so I hafta figure out a way to accept it .
35mb,PAR,105604,117444,and &-uh since then <it's> [/] you know it's still there .
35mb,PAR,117444,117644,and some days aren't great .
35mb,PAR,117644,117844,but I have a really good support system .
35mb,PAR,117844,127473,and I'm also not like <a> [/] &-uh a &-uh shy type of guy .
35mb,PAR,127473,139576,so you know I wouldn't say the effect on me is super high .
35mb,PAR,156065,161386,well the you know from age three to eighteen .

35mb,PAR,170316,177644,but &-uh not a_lot_of &-uh actual relief .
35mb,PAR,177644,185962,&-uh you know I mean I [/] I [/] I did everything from you know  hypnotherapy .
35mb,PAR,185962,188663,which also you know obviously didn't work .
35mb,PAR,188663,193447,to &-uh you know the tongue trick .
35mb,PAR,193447,195542,or the breathing trick .
35mb,PAR,195542,195742,and the &-uh <blah blah> [/] blah .
35mb,PAR,195742,195942,but &-uh yeah I mean it was sixteen .
35mb,PAR,195942,204040,seventeen years of that .
35mb,PAR,204040,204240,and you know it's still here .
35mb,PAR,204240,204440,so I mean yeah .
35mb,PAR,217811,228533,I think just conveying your point in [/] in a competent way .
35mb,PAR,228533,232833,I mean I've heard people who are you know so called fluent .
35mb,PAR,232833,237953,who [/] who can't even form a sentence .

35mb,PAR,241003,242895,who are you know disfluent .
35mb,PAR,242895,243095,you know I [/] I think just conveying your point .
35mb,PAR,243095,243295,I don't know .
35mb,PAR,253080,258919,I mean I've heard everything from you know it could be stress .
35mb,PAR,258919,258999,xxx .
35mb,PAR,258999,262188,and my grandad stuttered .
35mb,PAR,262188,265729,you know and he stuttered until he was twenty two .
35mb,PAR,265729,271431,and then it kind of was just gone after that .
35mb,PAR,271431,275489,you know so we [/] we always kind of hoped that [/] that would  happen to me .
35mb,PAR,275489,277236,and then that didn't happen .
35mb,PAR,277236,277436,I don't know .
35mb,PAR,277436,277636,&-uh I mean I met a &-uh girl .
35mb,PAR,277636,277836,at my first year at a conference .
35mb,PAR,277836,278036,who was fluent .
35mb,PAR,278036,278236,up until she was sixteen .
35mb,PAR,278236,286418,and one day she woke up .
35mb,PAR,286418,288257,and she stuttered .
35mb,PAR,288257,292956,so I mean who knows ?
35mb,PAR,292956,296006,but it's certainly not me .
35mb,PAR,296006,321052,<I [/] think> [/] I think other things in our lives [/] lives <has  the> [/] <has the> [/] &-uh has the ability to &-uh you know add  some pressure to [/] to things .
35mb,PAR,321052,322895,but I don't think that that's like the cause .
35mb,PAR,322895,323095,you know I [/] I [/] I [/] I you know if you're stressed out .
35mb,PAR,323095,323295,or you know depressed .
35mb,PAR,323295,323495,or this and that .
35mb,PAR,323495,339834,your mind and body can do things that you know like you know it  shouldn't always .
35mb,PAR,339834,339914,happen .
35mb,PAR,339914,340114,at [/] at [/] at an early age ?
35mb,PAR,348908,352477,yeah .
35mb,PAR,352477,359560,you know I mean you know I [/] I [/] I thought I was stupid .
35mb,PAR,359560,363729,I didn't [/] didn't have you know self worth .
35mb,PAR,363729,363929,&-uh I haven't thought about it in a negative though in probably  &-uh nine years .
35mb,PAR,363929,375854,since my first conference .
35mb,PAR,375854,383223,like it got really dark for a_lot_of years .
35mb,PAR,383223,386176,I wouldn't change it .
35mb,PAR,386176,387299,at all .
35mb,PAR,387299,401831,like [/] like I [/] I [/] I literally can't even imagine my life  now <if I> [/] if I hadn't found out about the n@l s@l a@l .
35mb,PAR,401831,409171,like [/] like I could have just not been here for the last nine  years .
35mb,PAR,409171,409371,you know and it's kind of insane .
35mb,PAR,409371,409571,because I've grown close to so many people .
35mb,PAR,409571,418159,who I just like love and cherish .
35mb,PAR,418159,422327,like it's an enormous part of who I am .
35mb,PAR,422327,422527,you know <I and> [//] I'm +...
35mb,PAR,422527,422607,yeah .
35mb,PAR,422607,422807,me personally .
35mb,PAR,422807,423007,I think it's more +//.
35mb,PAR,423007,423207,you know as I mentioned earlier .
35mb,PAR,423207,423407,about just trying to make sure that whoever is struggling .
35mb,PAR,442535,460295,finds a way to [/] to you know be comfortable with themself .
35mb,PAR,460295,460495,<that's> [//] you know I hear talk of the cure .
35mb,PAR,460495,460695,and this and that .
35mb,PAR,460695,460895,and I personally don't [/] don't think that's ever gonna happen .
35mb,PAR,460895,461095,you know in the like [/] like physical .
35mb,PAR,461095,461295,I'm going to take a pill .
35mb,PAR,461295,476135,or have a surgery type of way .
35mb,PAR,476135,480139,but <I believe> [/] I believe and I think that I'm cured .
35mb,PAR,480139,480339,you know because I got through it .
35mb,PAR,480339,480539,and I trust myself now .
35mb,PAR,480539,488256,and I know that it doesn't define me .
35mb,PAR,488256,488456,it's part of who I am .
35mb,PAR,488456,492630,<so I would> [//] I think I would stress that .
35mb,PAR,492630,502166,as [/] as like people needta [/] needta [/] needta know that there  is no cure .
35mb,PAR,502166,502366,and that you're gonna hafta figure out how to not let this giant  beast just overtake you .
35mb,PAR,502366,513120,because it can happen .
35mb,PAR,513120,513320,because <I would> [//] I think that .
35mb,PAR,513320,513400,yeah .
35mb,INV,199,279,okay .
35mb,INV,279,359,alright .
35mb,INV,359,559,so now can you &-um describe for me .
35mb,INV,559,759,the impact that stuttering has had .
35mb,INV,759,959,or does have .
35mb,INV,6376,15946,on your life .
35mb,INV,15946,19781,when you think about everyday activities .
35mb,INV,19781,19981,&-um work .
35mb,INV,19981,22615,&-um family .
35mb,INV,22615,22695,friends .
35mb,INV,22695,24904,possibly school .
35mb,INV,24904,26885,<what school> [//] what effect it had on school .
35mb,INV,26885,26965,okay .
35mb,INV,26965,27045,alright .
35mb,INV,139576,143462,I'm gonna follow up &-um with a different question .
35mb,INV,143462,143662,because you started discussing it .
35mb,INV,143662,148471,so one of the questions asks &-um if you've had therapy .
35mb,INV,148471,150407,which apparently you had .
35mb,INV,150407,156065,&-um you know what kinds of experiences and outcomes <did you> [/]  did you have ?
35mb,INV,204040,208574,okay .
35mb,INV,208574,208774,&-um so at this point if you could describe successful  communication .
35mb,INV,208774,217811,<what is that> [/] what is that to you at this point ?
35mb,INV,217811,218011,an example of successful communication .
35mb,INV,218011,218091,okay .
35mb,INV,242895,253080,&-um so do you have any thoughts about what causes stuttering ?
35mb,INV,253080,253160,right .
35mb,INV,253160,253240,yeah .
35mb,INV,253240,253320,yeah .
35mb,INV,253320,253520,I'd agree actually .
35mb,INV,253520,253720,<if> [//] have you ever thought about .
35mb,INV,253720,253920,if you didn't stutter .
35mb,INV,339834,348908,what might have been different in your life ?
35mb,INV,348908,348988,mhm .
35mb,INV,348988,349068,yeah .
35mb,INV,349068,349268,they're fantastic .
35mb,INV,349268,349468,they really are .
35mb,INV,349468,349668,&-um it seems as though you've had enough experience .
35mb,INV,422327,432578,to be able to tell an s@l l@l p@l something .
35mb,INV,432578,432778,if you had one message .
35mb,INV,432778,432978,to give somebody who was studying to be an s@l l@l p@l .
35mb,INV,432978,433178,who &-uh would treat you know people who stutter .
35mb,INV,433178,442535,what would you advise them ?
35mb,INV,442535,442735,or what would you tell them ?
35mb,INV,442735,442815,mhm .
35mb,INV,442815,442895,okay .
35mb,INV,442895,442975,alright .
35mb,INV,442975,443175,&-um I'm gonna turn this off .
35mb,INV,513120,520688,for one second .
25m,PAR,25942,53511,okay so currently &-um I am about to transition into &-um &-um xxx  so I'm in xxx job xxx thing and .
25m,PAR,53511,61428,and <so I'm> [/] so I'm busy with that so .
25m,PAR,61428,69845,&-um and finishing up the last bit of school so .
25m,PAR,69845,70045,&-um but &-um overall I would say that &-um it's generally positive  .
25m,PAR,70045,99282,and I try to express you know my stuttering as much as I can .
25m,PAR,99282,108933,&-um and [/] and try to keep that positive attitude .
25m,PAR,108933,112766,about it &-um .
25m,PAR,112766,112966,so I mean like I said you know it's I would say it's overall good .
25m,PAR,112966,113166,&-um as far as you know community activities .
25m,PAR,113166,147349,&-um <I'm> [//] really the two biggest things I'm involved with is  church and I'm [/] I'm an adult leader with the Boy_Scouts .
25m,PAR,147349,147549,&-um especially in the scouting program .
25m,PAR,147549,160613,&-um I find that it's a huge asset so &-um .
25m,PAR,160613,160813,so I think being involved with &-um those kind of activities in the  community .
25m,PAR,160813,186669,so you know that I can help other people with the experiences I've  had related to stuttering so .
25m,PAR,194563,198315,&-um <I'm> [//] let's see .
25m,PAR,198315,221198,&-um what I've seen that &-um it it's it seems like it's a  combination of &-um &-uh like &-uh genetics and neurological  conditions .
25m,PAR,221198,246368,&-um and I have heard of some cases of &-um stuttering being &-um  &-uh triggered by like a &-um environmental &-um &-um condition also  .
25m,PAR,246368,255074,but I still think the biggest thing is that there's &-um a genetic  component so .
25m,PAR,271175,297398,okay so &-um in preschool and in &-um elementary school &-um you  know those were actually quite awful &-um .
25m,PAR,297398,312967,it was you know it was simply you know because the therapists  didn't know anything about stuttering .
25m,PAR,312967,325293,&-um and so &-um I just remember just going there to play you know  a card game .
25m,PAR,325293,333897,or as practice and to have fun .
25m,PAR,333897,342678,but as far as therapy is concerned I didn't really have any I  didn't really get anything .
25m,PAR,342678,345715,from it .
25m,PAR,345715,350948,and then in middle school .
25m,PAR,350948,359349,I had probably the best therapist I've ever had .
25m,PAR,359349,364365,or at least up there &-um .
25m,PAR,364365,370432,she didn't know quite everything about stuttering .
25m,PAR,370432,400970,<but she took the time outside of our &~th> [//] oh and by the way  so far all these therapists <have been &~em> [//] <are &~em> [//] were  employed by the public school system .
25m,PAR,400970,422253,&-um but anyhow &-um this therapist she &-um took her extra time to  learn about stuttering .
25m,PAR,422253,436770,&-um and she &-um and she tried her hardest to &-uh help and get  feedback from me .
25m,PAR,436770,436970,&-um and then my high school &-uh therapist &-um she &~w &-um was  kind of had the same attitude .
25m,PAR,436970,467523,but I think I ended up teaching her .
25m,PAR,467523,482657,&-uh just because all of the stuff <I had been> [//] I had learned  through the National_Stuttering_Association and .
25m,PAR,482657,486709,&-um all of that so &-um .
25m,PAR,486709,496474,and then halfway through high school .
25m,PAR,496474,507792,&-um I took <a &~s> [//] <a &~th> [//] &-um a couple of &-um &-uh  intensive therapy programs .
25m,PAR,507792,511793,during the summer .
25m,PAR,511793,516963,&-um those were excellent .
25m,PAR,516963,521579,as [/] as <I'm> [//] I learned a ton of techniques .
25m,PAR,521579,528896,and &-um all kinds of you know like advertising .
25m,PAR,528896,531945,and self help .
25m,PAR,531945,538514,&-um just great times .
25m,PAR,538514,546281,and then also for a couple years in high school .
25m,PAR,546281,554818,I also had a private therapist also .
25m,PAR,554818,569694,and that was excellent because she specialized in fluency and  stuttering .
25m,PAR,569694,579247,&-um so &-um I [/] I had a great experience with her as well .
25m,PAR,579247,586314,and then after I graduated high school &-um .
25m,PAR,586314,600597,I actually stopped seeing <a &~th> [//] any kind of therapy .
25m,PAR,600597,600797,&-um so and I haven't since so .
25m,PAR,600797,608282,but I would say .
25m,PAR,608282,613234,overall I've had a good experience .
25m,PAR,638618,669137,I would say &-um that successful communication &-um includes the  ability to get your message and your point across .
25m,PAR,669137,676290,so there's different methods to that .
25m,PAR,676290,690360,and [/] and because_of that I don't really see stuttering as a  barrier .
25m,PAR,690360,697571,to that &-um .
25m,PAR,697571,705038,and sometimes it can even be an asset .
25m,PAR,705038,738958,&-um as far as &-um examples you know I really don't have a really  specific because I think I've had a bunch of successful &-um  experiences &-um .
25m,PAR,738958,755116,I would say I could pick out &-um the times I took communication  courses in high school .
25m,PAR,755116,759667,and college &-um .
25m,PAR,759667,763822,you know I mean even after &-um .
25m,PAR,763822,781401,or before I would give those &~s &-um those speeches in those  classes .
25m,PAR,781401,789669,even at the beginning of the course .
25m,PAR,789669,796725,I would sit down with the teacher or professor .
25m,PAR,796725,806419,and say here look I have this stutter .
25m,PAR,806419,818804,<I don't &~nece> [//] <I don't really &~w> [//] I want you to &-uh  &-um help &-um look past that .
25m,PAR,818804,833394,and grade me based upon the quality <of this of this of this> [/]  of this speech .
25m,PAR,833394,846792,&-um and because there really isn't anything in those courses that  necessarily says that my voice hasta be fluent .
25m,PAR,846792,852415,&-um <and so> [/] and so every time I would give those &-um .
25m,PAR,852415,860477,<I would> [/] I would both have excellent feedback .
25m,PAR,860477,868548,from both the teacher and the students .
25m,PAR,868548,874433,who are helping to critique it .
25m,PAR,874433,875508,and say you know what .
25m,PAR,875508,880214,I [/] I did a good job .
25m,PAR,880214,888547,you know of getting my message across .
25m,PAR,888547,894047,&-um you know despite that so .
25m,PAR,894047,894247,&-um yeah .
25m,PAR,908220,915582,oh well &-um I could think of a whole lot .
25m,PAR,915582,929160,&-um I definitely think I wouldn't have been the confident person  that I am today .
25m,PAR,929160,940657,&-um I you know I [/] I &~w I wouldn't have had the same experiences  .
25m,PAR,940657,951629,I wouldn't have gotten to know all the great people in the  stuttering community .
25m,PAR,951629,963961,&-um like yeah speaking would be &-um easier .
25m,PAR,963961,980912,but at the same time stuttering <gave me> [//] has [/] has given me  a_lot_of tenacity .
25m,PAR,980912,988675,and the &~ab <and the> [/] and the ability to have perseverance so .
25m,PAR,988675,1006909,I mean just to summarize that I just simply <wouldn't have &~b> [//]  wouldn't be the same person .
25m,PAR,1031694,1043228,&-um I would you know the biggest thing overall is to have patience  &-um .
25m,PAR,1043228,1068313,&-um you know and &-um <&~s> [//] and [/] and to understand that  stutterers aren't that much different than the average person .
25m,PAR,1068313,1072201,I mean everyone has their struggles .
25m,PAR,1072201,1080135,so &-um you know we're all have something .
25m,PAR,1080135,1085667,&-um I mean but about stuttering in general .
25m,PAR,1085667,1102282,I mean we are just as capable as doing anything else that anyone  you know that anyone could do .
25m,PAR,1102282,1108666,&-um it just happens to take us a bit longer .
25m,PAR,1108666,1111334,to talk &-um .
25m,PAR,1111334,1115034,yeah .
25m,INV,0,9075,talk about the impact of stuttering on your daily life .
25m,INV,9075,25942,you can talk about your interactions with family and friends school  and or work and your participation in community activities .
25m,INV,186669,194563,what do you think causes stuttering ?
25m,INV,255074,271175,if you have received treatment for your stuttering tell me about  your therapy experiences and the outcomes of these therapies .
25m,INV,271175,271375,please describe what successful communication means to you .
25m,INV,613234,638618,and can you give an example of a positive communicative experience  ?
25m,INV,894047,908220,if you didn't stutter what might be different in life ?
25m,INV,1006909,1031694,what else would you wanna say to students or the general public to  help them learn about stuttering or ways to support people who  stutter ?
503,PAR,15049,24620,sure well so in my daily life I'm in the army .
503,PAR,24620,34648,so I'm frequently speaking to crowds of soldiers or other officers  .
503,PAR,34648,47799,and so sometimes I hafta to start by being very directive to gain  control of the situation .
503,PAR,47799,47999,and then everyone's quite patient if I do have some stuttering .
503,PAR,47999,48199,well generally cause I'm their boss .
503,PAR,48199,48399,but also because their are some decent humans beings around that  they recognize that .
503,PAR,48399,79544,but yeah in daily life with my family it isn't and issue .
503,PAR,79544,79744,and I don't think about it when I go into stores or when I order  food .
503,PAR,79744,89949,which is a good thing .
503,PAR,89949,90149,I used to have my wife order pizza for us .
503,PAR,90149,100658,or anything from the phone .
503,PAR,100658,100858,and it was before you could do it online .
503,PAR,100858,101058,cause I'm old .
503,PAR,101058,101258,but then one day she stopped .
503,PAR,101258,101458,she refused so now I order my own food .
503,PAR,101458,101658,sometimes online .
503,PAR,101658,121694,but sometimes on call .
503,PAR,121694,121894,I think it's being too hansom .
503,PAR,121894,122094,yeah probably you know I looked in the mirror and I started  stuttering .
503,PAR,122094,122294,yeah no I don't know .
503,PAR,126665,147426,and I'm no scientist .
503,PAR,147426,147626,but yeah I think it's brain related .
503,PAR,147626,147826,and that transference from thought to speech or articulation .
503,PAR,147826,165636,something like that .
503,PAR,165636,165716,yeah .
503,PAR,176683,189083,yeah so I did a precision fluency shaping program all throughout my  school years from kindergarten to grade eight .
503,PAR,189083,200962,then when I was seventeen I did the first of three intensive  programs .
503,PAR,200962,201162,it was a program called essential pause in Otowa .
503,PAR,201162,230131,and it worked on not only the gental onset and that you learn but  also trying to take natural pauses as everyone does since everyone's  naturally disfluent .
503,PAR,230131,230331,and then the final stage was adding ums and uhs into those pauses  so_that it doesn't sound like I'm pausing .
503,PAR,230331,230531,so_that I don't run low on air or so I'm not pausing so I don't  block .
503,PAR,230531,230731,but it's just normal speech right so .
503,PAR,230731,230931,I'm not sure if I do it well anymore or not since it was in two  thousand and three .
503,PAR,230931,231131,and I haven't had any therapy since then .
503,PAR,231131,231331,but yeah on an average day I don't ever think about speaking .
503,PAR,231331,231531,I just do it .
503,PAR,231531,277432,&=laughs .
503,PAR,288897,310512,yeah I think that having positive communication is certainly any  communication that is meaningful .
503,PAR,310512,330648,I think if you are able to be you genuine self who is also trying  to do that [/] that is the most important thing .
503,PAR,330648,330848,in terms of an example +...
503,PAR,330848,360878,I used to mentor teenagers who stutter and there were quite a few  who thought that their career options were limited because_of their  stuttering .
503,PAR,360878,361078,and so I was able to share my experiences so far .
503,PAR,361078,361278,and that seemed to give them hope that they aren't relegated to  non-speaking low paying jobs .
503,PAR,361278,384338,and I say that's probably the best example I have .
503,PAR,384338,384343,hm .
503,PAR,384343,384543,&=laughs .
503,PAR,395649,407791,probably not too much .
503,PAR,407791,407991,I'm doing what I always wanted to do .
503,PAR,407991,408191,maybe I'd be a higher rank in the military .
503,PAR,408191,432792,but yeah so I don't see too much being too different .
503,PAR,432792,432992,maybe I'd be rich too .
503,PAR,432992,433192,but you_know maybe not .
503,PAR,433192,433392,so [=! laughs] .
503,PAR,433392,433592,that's right .
503,PAR,451529,462407,oh well yeah I just think that it's important not to underestimate  anyone .
503,PAR,462407,462607,everyone is capable of anything that they can think of right ?
503,PAR,462607,462807,I mean you just need a plan and then action .
503,PAR,462807,476261,so I'd say that's it anyway .
503,PAR,476261,476461,yeah that's the big thing .
503,PAR,476461,479343,yeah no problem .
503,INV,199,15049,you can talk about your interactions with family with friends  school and or work and your participation in community activities .
503,INV,15049,15249,great thanks for that .
503,INV,121694,126665,second I want to ask you what you think causes stuttering ?
503,INV,126665,126865,&=laughs .
503,INV,126865,127065,next I want to ask you if you've ever received therapy for you  stuttering .
503,INV,165636,176683,and if so can you tell me about your therapy experiences and the  outcomes of those therapies .
503,INV,277432,288897,can you give an example of a positive communicative experience ?
503,INV,288897,289097,I also want to ask you what your perspective is on this question .
503,INV,384338,395649,if you didn't stutter what would be different in your life ?
503,INV,395649,395849,wouldn't we all like that .
503,INV,432792,451529,and finally I want to ask you what else would you like to say to  the students or the general public to help them learn about ways to  support people who stutter ?
503,INV,451529,451729,thank_you .
24fb,PAR,28584,35350,&-um in my daily life it does not really have an impact on me .
24fb,PAR,35350,42594,&-um because I don't allow it to have an impact on me &-um .
24fb,PAR,42594,59751,&-uh I think it's worse in my job &-uh where I talk to customers  and they don't know that I stutter and I hafta be very professional  and &-uh .
24fb,PAR,59751,79653,I work in a shop so I hafta &-uh be professional and not stutter  that much but in my daily life with friends and family it does not  really have an impact on me I think &-um .
24fb,PAR,79653,86378,because everyone knows that I stutter and it's just a part of me  and it's the way I talk .
24fb,PAR,86378,88528,I guess .
24fb,PAR,96333,111491,&-um I don't know but I think it's you know <it's a in my family>  [//] it's a family thing it's <in my &-uh> [//] in my dad's part of  the family .
24fb,PAR,111491,111691,so I think it's a biological thing I guess but otherwise [/]  otherwise I don't know I mean there are so many &-um .
24fb,PAR,111691,139560,I know people think it's some kind of a trauma or something like  that but I'm not sure about that I think it's in the genes and yeah  .
24fb,PAR,154517,163525,I went to my first speech therapist when I was <four> [//] five  years old .
24fb,PAR,163525,174419,and it was <a &-uh> [//] a group of children and it was about how  to accept stuttering and not how to cure it and .
24fb,PAR,174419,194907,it was about meeting other children who stutter <and &-um> [//] and  I think the most important thing was to accept it and learn how to  live with it and how to deal with it and learn that there's no cure  .
24fb,PAR,194907,203455,&-um and I went to that group for a_lot_of years &-um .
24fb,PAR,203455,209964,<I ended when I was> [//] it ended when I was seventeen .
24fb,PAR,209964,216398,so it was most of my childhood I went to that group .
24fb,PAR,216398,232588,and in the end I didn't go because I learned anything or because I  went for the social part it was nice being there and yeah .
24fb,PAR,258022,265673,&-um well that's a difficult question .
24fb,PAR,265673,265873,&-um positive communication I don't &-um .
24fb,PAR,265873,291459,I don't think that it's &-um it's a question of whether you stutter  or not and positive communication makes sense &-um .
24fb,PAR,291459,309864,&-um I don't think that stuttering has anything to do with positive  communication that's a difficult question .
24fb,PAR,321147,344943,it's &-um &-um it's I mean it's just you know <if I well> [//] it's  a bit technical but if I send a message and the receiver understands  the message I mean that's communication right and .
24fb,PAR,344943,350103,&-um I don't know what to answer to that question .
24fb,PAR,350103,362789,I'm not sure that &-um successful and stuttering have anything to  do with each_other .
24fb,PAR,362789,366599,yeah .
24fb,PAR,375373,396782,&-um &-um well I'm about to stay here this meeting but that's a  <bit> [//] that's not really a good answer .
24fb,PAR,396782,402745,&-um I think that's the best answer I can give .
24fb,PAR,402745,406391,but I don't know .
24fb,PAR,417803,423473,oh a_lot_of things would be different &-um .
24fb,PAR,423473,433719,a_lot_of things I have traveled a lot because_of my stuttering .
24fb,PAR,433719,437862,I have met a_lot_of people because_of my stuttering .
24fb,PAR,437862,452103,and I wouldn't live the life I am living now and it's &-um it would  be really different it's &-um .
24fb,PAR,452103,452303,I don't know <what it would> [//] how it would look like but &-um  <I'm not sure I would> [//] I'm not sure <what study> [//] what I'm  studying now because I &-um .
24fb,PAR,452303,476813,and I wouldn't know the friends I know and a_lot_of things would be  different .
24fb,PAR,476813,480915,yeah a lot .
24fb,PAR,503975,508822,I think the most important is to meet other people who stutter .
24fb,PAR,508822,516811,and &-uh no matter if you are a student or whatever &-um .
24fb,PAR,516811,531717,<and tell> [//] find someone tell your teacher and colleagues and  <your> [//] the &-uh people &-uh around you that you stutter .
24fb,PAR,531717,538633,so they know what it is and they don't think that you're weird or  anything .
24fb,PAR,538633,543767,&-um I'm not sure I answered the question but &-um .
24fb,PAR,543767,554930,tell people that you stutter and meet other people who stutter I  think that's the most important so you don't feel alone .
24fb,PAR,563970,575952,&-um they should just accept it and they should not finish what  &-uh I'm about to say and they should &-um .
24fb,PAR,575952,580104,just behave like it's a normal thing and .
24fb,PAR,580104,588318,yeah and of course if they wanna ask questions they can do and .
24fb,PAR,588318,592181,just accept it and behave like it's nothing special .
24fb,INV,0,28584,please talk about the impact of stuttering on your daily life you  can talk about your interactions with family and friends school and  or work and your participation in community activities .
24fb,INV,88528,96333,what do you think causes stuttering ?
24fb,INV,139560,154517,if you have received treatment for your stuttering tell me about  therapy experiences and outcomes of these therapies .
24fb,INV,232588,258022,please describe what successful communication means to you and can  you provide an example of a positive communicative experience .
24fb,INV,309864,321147,how would you describe successful communication or what does  successful communication mean to you ?
24fb,INV,366599,375373,and can you give me an example of a positive communicative  experience that you've had .
24fb,INV,406391,417803,if you didn't stutter what might be different in your life .
24fb,INV,480915,503975,what else would you wanna say to students or the general public to  help them learn about stuttering or ways to support people who  stutter .
24fb,INV,554930,563970,and how do you think others can best support people who stutter ?
29mc,PAR,11779,19281,&-um historically my stuttering has &-uh prevented me or held me  back .
29mc,PAR,19281,27954,in &-um school activities &-uh public activities &-um .
29mc,PAR,27954,32664,I have always been pretty open with my family .
29mc,PAR,32664,43211,&-uh and friends but not about my stuttering it has always been a  taboo &-like topic .
29mc,PAR,43211,47623,&-um but &-um .
29mc,PAR,47623,53323,recently &-uh I have been a part of the n@l s@l a@l .
29mc,PAR,53323,63148,and &-uh it's [/] it's been opening up this new world of acceptance  to me .
29mc,PAR,63148,71203,&-um to where I now kind of put myself out there more and &-um .
29mc,PAR,71203,80713,and don't let the fact that I stutter kind of shape the way I am  &-um .
29mc,PAR,80713,96169,and then &-um taking a bigger part in the n@l s@l a@l as a chapter  leader has really kind of pushed me more <in the> [/] in the  direction of acceptance .
29mc,PAR,96169,107264,and [/] and &-uh I've been seeing <more> [//] &-uh &-uh less of a  holdback &-um due to my stuttering &-um .
29mc,PAR,107264,119221,and in my workplace and college I useta work at Target and I've had  &-uh problems with managers making fun of my stuttering .
29mc,PAR,119221,130260,&-um but then I got a campus job where I had an amazing manager  <and> [/] &-um and then I now work in the Healthcare field with  doctors .
29mc,PAR,130260,135295,and that's been amazing because they also understand stuttering .
29mc,PAR,136495,143412,and its [/] its [/] its been a [/] a [/] a great experience now for  me .
29mc,PAR,148526,156213,&-um <that's so> [//] I'm not an expert in stuttering .
29mc,PAR,156213,159539,I [//] I'm very much only a stutterer .
29mc,PAR,159539,166590,&-uh I've heard it's &-um <brain> [//] <some> [//] something in the  brain &-uh .
29mc,PAR,166590,171235,<some> [//] I've also heard &-like chemicals in the body .
29mc,PAR,171235,185452,&-uh &-um but I guess as a stutterer for me I know what causes my  severe stuttering patterns and that's anxiety .
29mc,PAR,185452,194589,and &-uh kind of &-um anticipation for words that are coming up .
29mc,PAR,195133,197374,and &-um yeah that's it .
29mc,PAR,197374,197574,so &-uh therapy started when I was like four years old .
29mc,PAR,207032,218848,my mom made special arrangements with the elementary school .
29mc,PAR,218848,224278,to &-uh have me start therapy &-uh .
29mc,PAR,224278,228539,even before I started kindergarten .
29mc,PAR,228539,244800,so <I went> [//] I've been in and out_of school therapy up until  middle school and then I gave up on the school therapy around ninth  grade when I started high school .
29mc,PAR,244800,260190,&-um and then I also went to the Hollins_Fluency_Program which &-uh  is a fluency shaping &-uh program in high school .
29mc,PAR,260190,273827,and &-um I think I get most of my techniques from what they've  taught me at Hollins which is &-uh stressed syllables .
29mc,PAR,273827,283219,and &-um easy onsets and &-um I think I use those &-uh not like  unknowingly .
29mc,PAR,283219,283419,and &-um I'm now looking at other &-uh programs +/.
29mc,PAR,283419,304292,well I recently went to a speech therapist through my health  insurance and kind of got out_of that after a couple of appointments  because it was just &-uh not [/] not worth my time I'd say .
29mc,PAR,304292,311327,and &-um I'm looking at Vivian_Sisskin's program for the future .
29mc,PAR,321255,327588,&-uh <maybe> [//] successful communication +...
29mc,PAR,327588,344165,I would say &-uh for me now successful communication means getting  my point across to the other person I'm communicating with .
29mc,PAR,344165,350984,&-um let's say &-uh at work I'm in &-like a meeting .
29mc,PAR,350984,366675,&-um and I needta get some technical detail over to other members  of my team to just convey some requirement <of a> [/] of a design .
29mc,PAR,366675,366875,&-um often it takes skill to kind of &-um understand what they  don't understand and to kind of clarify that back .
29mc,PAR,366875,384034,so if we are able to go back and forth .
29mc,PAR,384034,384234,after the meeting everyone is on the same page .
29mc,PAR,384234,384434,&-like I would consider that a <successful &-uh communication> [/]  &-uh &-um successful communication &-uh thing .
29mc,PAR,384434,402972,&=laughs .
29mc,PAR,402972,403172,&-um I've often thought about that .
29mc,PAR,408606,417293,and in our chapter we always revisit that question .
29mc,PAR,417293,420853,because it's interesting I kind of go back and fourth .
29mc,PAR,420853,432552,and I try to now look at the positives which is I probably wouldn't  be as compassionate if I didn't stutter .
29mc,PAR,432552,441525,&-um I probably wouldn't be as dedicated and &-um have as much  drive &-um if I didn't stutter .
29mc,PAR,441525,449915,&-um but then there are other things that I still think would be  easier like growing up especially .
29mc,PAR,449915,450115,&-um I would probably have had a better time in high school .
29mc,PAR,450115,457835,had better grades in high school .
29mc,PAR,457835,464314,and &-um finished school a lot sooner if I was fluent .
29mc,PAR,464314,473380,and therefore probably be ahead of where I am now because I think  stuttering has put obstacles in my way .
29mc,PAR,473380,476732,but I focus on the positives now .
29mc,PAR,476732,476932,&-um I would say that everyone who I come across who asks me about  my stutter .
29mc,PAR,486813,505911,I say I am not an expert in stutter but &-uh all I ask is for you  to give me time .
29mc,PAR,505911,516599,and [/] and &-um [/] and that there's nothing really physically  wrong with me .
29mc,PAR,516599,527989,it's &-uh just a different <speech> [//] communication pattern .
29mc,PAR,527989,529639,that I have .
29mc,INV,0,5143,please talk about the impact of stuttering on your daily life .
29mc,INV,5143,5343,you can talk about your interactions with family and friends .
29mc,INV,5343,5543,school and or work .
29mc,INV,5543,11779,and your participation in community activities .
29mc,INV,143412,148526,what do you think causes stuttering ?
29mc,INV,197374,207032,if you have received treatment for your stuttering tell me about  your therapy experiences and the outcomes of these therapies .
29mc,INV,207032,207232,please describe what successful communication means to you .
29mc,INV,311327,321255,and can you give an example of a positive communicative experience  ?
29mc,INV,402972,404744,cool .
29mc,INV,404744,408606,if you didn't stutter what would be different in your life ?
29mc,INV,477605,486813,what else would you wanna say to students or to the general public  to help them learn about stuttering or ways to support people who  stutter ?
34m,PAR,13981,15898,any specific one to start with ?
34m,PAR,15898,19483,okay yes maam .
34m,PAR,19483,23332,alright well &-um well &-um my early school .
34m,PAR,23332,29651,&-um schooling was pretty difficult you know difficult &-um <you  know> [/] you know difficult &-um .
34m,PAR,29651,29851,I did not have speech therapy when I was in grade school .
34m,PAR,29851,36099,<you know> [/] you know grade school .
34m,PAR,36099,40484,&-um when I did have some in high school .
34m,PAR,40484,43318,it was not very effective speech therapy you know .
34m,PAR,43318,43518,speech therapy .
34m,PAR,43518,47169,&-um I was part of a group .
34m,PAR,47169,62785,that included some <you know> [/] you know included [/] included  <you know> [/] you know included &-um people that didn't have a  stutter .
34m,PAR,62785,62985,so I just read in a corner and just kind of did my own thing .
34m,PAR,62985,70469,which is not very effective speech therapy .
34m,PAR,70469,70669,so &-um you know .
34m,PAR,70669,77453,&-um my social life has been fairly good .
34m,PAR,77453,82055,I <you know> [/] you know good you know good &-uh you know good .
34m,PAR,82055,86253,&-um I talk to people that I needta talk .
34m,PAR,86253,95706,I am friendly towards &-um towards &-um people you know people &-um  .
34m,PAR,95706,95906,I probably have not done some specific things at certain times .
34m,PAR,95906,106288,because I didn't feel like trying extra hard .
34m,PAR,106288,106488,to be fluent .
34m,PAR,106488,112222,or just didn't feel like struggling so .
34m,PAR,112222,112422,there are some situations that I probably have not done .
34m,PAR,112422,119873,because I didn't feel like stuttering through it .
34m,PAR,119873,120073,&-um you asked what else xxx .
34m,PAR,124478,129190,&-um .
34m,PAR,129190,135456,well I &-uh I went to school for anthropology .
34m,PAR,135456,137708,I've also done music .
34m,PAR,137708,142808,I am you know kind of went back to school for respiratory therapy .
34m,PAR,142808,149959,and now I'm working as an e@l k@l g@l tech .
34m,PAR,149959,154974,so my job is to stare at squiggly lines all day .
34m,PAR,154974,155174,that's what I do .
34m,PAR,155174,155374,it's nice .
34m,PAR,155374,155574,it's fun .
34m,PAR,155574,155774,oh [/] oh &-um oh &-um my spouse is also here .
34m,PAR,155774,155974,<you know> [/] you know here you know here .
34m,PAR,157992,169710,I tried at one point .
34m,PAR,169710,192577,to you know <to to to to> [/] to &-um become an e@l an [/] an &-um  e@l m@l t@l .
34m,PAR,192577,192777,t@l you know t@l &-um t@l you know t@l &-um .
34m,PAR,192777,192977,&-um the instructors &-um they said that my speech could have been  a problem .
34m,PAR,192977,207030,<you know> [/] you know problem .
34m,PAR,207030,207230,in hindsight it might have been a problem or not .
34m,PAR,207230,213096,I don't know .
34m,PAR,213096,222447,but I switched from that to respiratory care .
34m,PAR,222447,222527,so yeah .
34m,PAR,222527,227346,yes so_that was definitely an impact .
34m,PAR,227346,229697,good call wife thank you .
34m,PAR,229697,242966,oh &-um .
34m,PAR,242966,250765,sure well &-um well you know well &-um my father was a stutterer  until he was fourteen .
34m,PAR,250765,252899,and then he stopped you know stopped .
34m,PAR,252899,253099,&-uh you know stopped .
34m,PAR,253099,261584,&-um my parents pretty much thought I would just spontaneously quit  stuttering so .
34m,PAR,261584,267216,I don't think that they really tried to get me more speech therapy  .
34m,PAR,267216,267416,so I didn't have speech therapy until I went to high school .
34m,PAR,267416,273950,because then it was public stuff .
34m,PAR,273950,274150,but it was just not a very good setting .
34m,PAR,274150,274350,you know &-um setting you know setting .
34m,PAR,274350,283349,&-um the only good speech therapy that I've had was in college .
34m,PAR,283349,283549,<you know> [/] you know college .
34m,PAR,283549,283749,&-um and [/] and &-um I found that to be a lot more helpful .
34m,PAR,283749,283949,you know and outside of college I really haven't had speech therapy  .
34m,PAR,283949,298169,because it costs a_lot_of money .
34m,PAR,298169,298369,and I can't .
34m,PAR,309737,318702,successful communication is when you can get your message across to  the person that you are speaking to .
34m,PAR,318702,324631,it doesn't matter if you start mumbling or if you start signing or  if you stutter .
34m,PAR,324631,336521,it <you know you know> [/] you know &-um if the person you are  speaking to or sorry if the person that you are communicating to .
34m,PAR,336521,336721,if they get the thought that's in your head in their head .
34m,PAR,336721,343738,that to me is successful communication .
34m,PAR,343738,343938,via text talk you know smacking them upside the head you know .
34m,PAR,347721,351173,communication is communication .
34m,PAR,351173,351373,if I didn't stutter I would have flowy long locks .
34m,PAR,369540,372424,and I would have endless money .
34m,PAR,372424,372624,you know like it is such a removed concept of who and what you know  like I .
34m,PAR,372624,390359,I wouldn't know what a non stuttering me would even do or be you  know .
34m,PAR,390359,390559,you know be &-um .
34m,PAR,390559,390759,might I have a different job ?
34m,PAR,390759,394692,possibly .
34m,PAR,394692,398625,I might not be married to my wife or have my children .
34m,PAR,398625,398825,or my house so .
34m,PAR,398825,403959,I like where I'm at .
34m,PAR,403959,406743,you know stuttering or not so .
34m,PAR,406743,415143,I you know so I wouldn't change my life situation because I  wouldn't it to be different .
34m,PAR,415143,415343,maybe more hair though .
34m,PAR,426992,431944,&-uh no one knows the exact cause of <stuttering you know> [/]  stuttering you know .
34m,PAR,431944,432144,you know stuttering .
34m,PAR,432144,437662,&-um there seems to be a strong genetic link to stuttering .
34m,PAR,437662,441761,&-um I have two boys .
34m,PAR,441761,446629,so they aren't old enough to really see if they do stutter or not .
34m,PAR,446629,446829,so I'm watching them like hawks .
34m,PAR,446829,447029,<you know> [/] you know &-um as for what causes it .
34m,PAR,447029,457171,it's influenced by your emotions .
34m,PAR,457171,462329,and by whatever part in your brain causes you to actually stutter .
34m,PAR,462329,464146,no one really knows .
34m,PAR,464146,464151,so .
34m,PAR,464151,464351,I'm sure for some people it's very [/] very different too .
34m,PAR,464351,473165,and <they know> [/] they know &-um I know .
34m,PAR,473165,473365,that you can have a fluent person that has trauma .
34m,PAR,473365,473565,<and then> [/] and then they now are a stutterer always .
34m,PAR,473565,486100,and that's you know I don't know .
34m,PAR,486100,486180,xxx .
34m,PAR,509883,522636,I think that the most important part to you know &-um the you know  &-um the most important part .
34m,PAR,522636,524752,about stuttering .
34m,PAR,524752,534801,is that there is so much emotional issues [/] issues <you know> [/]  you know issues &-um .
34m,PAR,534801,535001,every you know &-um every speech person that has gone through any  class .
34m,PAR,535001,556684,should have probably heard about the iceberg stuttering &-um you  know &-uh <you know> [/] you know .
34m,PAR,556684,566137,you know &-um I personally I have had a_lot_of emotional problems  and concepts that existed .
34m,PAR,566137,570905,for a long [/] long time because I didn't really have speech  therapy you know .
34m,PAR,570905,578940,so just please keep in mind that you hafta treat the speech  problems that the person has .
34m,PAR,578940,589455,but that's a very [/] very small part about the entire you know  &-um complexity that makes a person a stutterer .
34m,INV,0,13981,&-um so could you tell me &-um what the impact of stuttering has  been in your life &-um on schooling on your social life family &-um  your choice of vacation ?
34m,INV,13981,14181,you can do as much or as little as you want in any order you want .
34m,INV,119873,124478,&-um .
34m,INV,124478,124678,&-uh so &-um so maybe your choice of occupation or .
34m,INV,124678,124878,&=laughs .
34m,INV,154974,157992,okay .
34m,INV,157992,158192,right &-um hm .
34m,INV,158192,158392,so_that would definitely have been an impact .
34m,INV,158392,158592,so you don't necessarily hafta say more than you already did .
34m,INV,158592,158792,but one question was about previous therapy experiences .
34m,INV,158792,158992,&-um did you have any other &-um experiences .
34m,INV,158992,159192,or do you wanna reflect on why it was that you didn't get therapy  when you were younger ?
34m,INV,159192,159272,yes .
34m,INV,298169,309737,okay &-um so you could &-um in your own mind what's [/] what's an  example of successful communication these days for you ?
34m,INV,343738,347721,&=laughs .
34m,INV,347721,347921,&-um &-uh if [/] if you didn't stutter did you ever stop to think .
34m,INV,347921,348121,you know sort of a what if moment .
34m,INV,348121,348321,like I useta imagine what if I was tall and blond .
34m,INV,348321,348521,&-um what if you didn't stutter .
34m,INV,351173,365669,how might your life have been different .
34m,INV,365669,369540,&=laughs .
34m,INV,369540,369740,great &-um .
34m,INV,369740,369820,okay .
34m,INV,415143,420393,&=laughs .
34m,INV,420393,420593,I think we can all wish for that .
34m,INV,420593,420793,&-um so here's a head scratcher .
34m,INV,420793,426992,what do you think causes stuttering ?
34m,INV,426992,427192,fair enough .
34m,INV,427192,427392,it's an unfair question but we thought we'd ask it of everybody .
34m,INV,486100,489696,okay .
34m,INV,489696,489896,the last question is perhaps the most important .
34m,INV,489896,498564,&-um so these will be viewed primarily by students who are studying  to become speech language pathologists .
34m,INV,498564,502066,who we would hope aspire someday to work with people who stutter .
34m,INV,502066,502266,what would you want them to know .
34m,INV,502266,509883,what's the most important thing in your mind for a speech language  pathologist to know about stuttering or people who stutter ?
34m,INV,589455,591189,that is wonderful .
60m,PAR,15661,24944,&-uh I'm currently <the president> [//] the chapter leader for the  National_Middle_Tenessee chapter of the  National_Stuttering_Association .
60m,PAR,24944,29460,I'm also president of a Toastmasters group called the  Freelance_Communicators .
60m,PAR,29460,32943,which is only the third one in the entire world .
60m,PAR,32943,39611,and it was formed for [/] for the purpose <of those> [/] of those  who stutter .
60m,PAR,39611,41660,I'm going to cut this off .
60m,PAR,41660,53445,I &-um a let's see I've been a member of the n@l s@l a@l since &-uh  two thousand three .
60m,PAR,53445,59330,and I've been a Toastmaster since two thousand seven .
60m,PAR,59330,59530,&-um at this point in my life this point in my career a_lot_of the  things I do is volunteer work .
60m,PAR,59530,72991,it's all <it's it's> [/] it's all about giving back .
60m,PAR,72991,75881,I'm also a Uber a Lyft driver .
60m,PAR,75881,84380,and I like doing that because with each rider that gets in the car  <I have> [/] I have a chance to practice my speech therapy .
60m,PAR,84380,91018,and even though I've been offered other jobs at other universities  (be)cause I have several degrees .
60m,PAR,91018,98165,I [/] I turned down <an an> [/] an adjunct instructor position at  this small college .
60m,PAR,98165,98365,(be)cause I would prefer to be a Lyft driver Uber driver .
60m,PAR,98365,107649,because I [/] I get a chance to practice my speech therapy every  day .
60m,PAR,107649,110450,with each person .
60m,PAR,110450,113066,and when they get to the point of asking what I do .
60m,PAR,113066,113266,I tell them about my volunteer work .
60m,PAR,113266,119811,but I also say I'm I am a person that stutters .
60m,PAR,119811,123318,and for this ride you are my guinea pig .
60m,PAR,123318,129801,so when I'm talking to you I'm actually practicing my speech  therapy techniques .
60m,PAR,129801,136467,<and I've> [/] and I've met a_lot_of people <that have> [//] that  either stutter themselves .
60m,PAR,136467,139019,and then we talk about that during the ride .
60m,PAR,139019,142919,or they have family members or friends that they know that stutter  .
60m,PAR,142919,145018,but were afraid to approach them .
60m,PAR,145018,147752,so many times during the ride .
60m,PAR,147752,150352,it's an educational process about stuttering .
60m,PAR,157318,159735,what do I think causes stuttering .
60m,PAR,159735,159935,well I [/] I know a little bit more than just the average person  that stutters .
60m,PAR,159935,167720,(be)cause I go to Doctor Proper_name's &-um lectures all the time .
60m,PAR,167720,167920,and also Doctor McGuire's .
60m,PAR,167920,168120,so it's a multifactorial multimodal cause .
60m,PAR,168120,177371,<it's it's> [/] it's I know part of it is genetic .
60m,PAR,177371,182438,part of it I think that you can be born with the tendency to  stutter .
60m,PAR,182438,184454,based on your family history .
60m,PAR,184454,190589,and if you and [/] and if [/] if and all depending on what the  right environment you may or may not stutter .
60m,PAR,190589,196105,<so I don't think it's anything that> [//] it's not one thing that  causes it .
60m,PAR,196105,200939,but there are several things that may influence the expression of  stuttering .
60m,PAR,200939,205156,so you may have the genotype but the phenotype may not be expressed  .
60m,PAR,205156,205356,&-uh so it's caused by a number of reasons .
60m,PAR,205356,210705,which they're still trying to find out .
60m,PAR,210705,210905,I [/] I have .
60m,PAR,224307,226424,well let me see .
60m,PAR,226424,231474,if it was I know I've been stuttering for as long as I can remember  .
60m,PAR,231474,236882,when I was in grade school <I> [//] <we were> [//] <they put us>  [//] they put me in a speech class .
60m,PAR,236882,237683,I didn't know why .
60m,PAR,237683,238734,they didn't say I stuttered .
60m,PAR,238734,239767,it was just a speech class .
60m,PAR,239767,242018,so I thought I was in it because I was smart .
60m,PAR,242018,252309,then &-um <and I> [/] and I did receive some speech therapy from  some guy because the state paid for it .
60m,PAR,252309,256459,or something but I didn't like his methods so I didn't buy into it  .
60m,PAR,256459,256659,he said I had some he like a he said I had a thick tongue and a  thick frenulum .
60m,PAR,256659,264959,and he wanted me to practice some quacky technique .
60m,PAR,264959,265159,I didn't buy into that .
60m,PAR,265159,268044,so I [/] I went to him because I hadta but .
60m,PAR,268044,269477,that was just it .
60m,PAR,269477,272456,and upon graduation from .
60m,PAR,272456,274711,<high> [//] before graduation from high school .
60m,PAR,274711,274911,my counselor told me that I should go into some type of a trade  school or menial labor job .
60m,PAR,274911,284994,because I may not survive in college .
60m,PAR,284994,289145,and of course I did I just I didn't see her any more after that .
60m,PAR,289145,293412,<but I did> [/] but I did go to Howard_University for my  undergraduate .
60m,PAR,293412,295245,&-um on scholarship .
60m,PAR,295245,301415,&-um and I [/] I enrolled in &-um their speech therapy programs .
60m,PAR,301415,301615,and <I don't> [/] I don't remember a_lot_of it .
60m,PAR,301615,305679,but I think it helped me a lot .
60m,PAR,305679,310601,but what helped me more in undergraduate and even until now .
60m,PAR,310601,315580,is stepping outside of our stepping outside of our comfort zone .
60m,PAR,315580,319529,joining clubs joining activities that force me to speak .
60m,PAR,319529,319729,so I did a_lot_of that while I was at Howard .
60m,PAR,319729,319929,(be)cause I was in the student government .
60m,PAR,319929,324981,I was in the air force for r@l o@l t@l c@l .
60m,PAR,324981,330898,but the speech therapy kept me I guess focused on practicing .
60m,PAR,330898,338398,then &-uh after undergraduate &-um xxx graduation came to Nashville  .
60m,PAR,338398,347282,and [/] and when I was in grad school and med school I &-um I did  speech therapy at the xxx Wilson_Center .
60m,PAR,347282,356199,&-um back in let's see the first time <it was> [/] it was &-uh  group therapy which was good .
60m,PAR,356199,358782,but the second time it was with just one therapist .
60m,PAR,358782,362417,and &-um I [/] I forgot her name but .
60m,PAR,362417,365501,last name is [/] is Lastname but .
60m,PAR,365501,368818,I got the most out_of her because she made me practice .
60m,PAR,368818,372750,<she didn't let> [/] she didn't let me get away with anything .
60m,PAR,372750,376003,and she called me on my b@l s@l .
60m,PAR,376003,381036,you know and <so I> [//] <she she> [//] I really bonded with her .
60m,PAR,381036,385352,psychologically (be)cause she made me realize that she really cared  about me .
60m,PAR,385352,390968,and with all my education and all the xxx she wouldn't let me get  by with anything .
60m,PAR,390968,397269,you know she said you know she made me realize that I'm coming to  her in for a reason .
60m,PAR,397269,400453,and if I don't practice then I'm just wasting my time .
60m,PAR,400453,400653,and her time .
60m,PAR,400653,403869,so I got the most out_of that .
60m,PAR,403869,405371,(be)cause she made me practice .
60m,PAR,420753,427405,successful communication means delivering your message .
60m,PAR,427405,430338,whether you stutter or not .
60m,PAR,430338,430538,it's making sure that the person on <the other end> [/] the other  end .
60m,PAR,430538,435931,the receiver of that message .
60m,PAR,435931,440872,<got> [//] heard you and got the context of what you were trying to  say .

60m,PAR,441077,441277,&=laughs .
60m,PAR,450668,452525,if I did not stutter .
60m,PAR,452525,456613,well <I've I've> [/] I've <I have> [/] I have already achieved  a_lot_of success .
60m,PAR,456613,458918,but it was a struggle at each way .
60m,PAR,458918,464111,and there were some things I didn't do <because_of> [/] because_of  my stuttering .
60m,PAR,464111,464311,&-um I have a medical degree .
60m,PAR,464311,469723,but I could have gone further with it .
60m,PAR,469723,473374,<if if> [/] if I didn't stutter .
60m,PAR,473374,476075,&-uh so <I> [//] if I didn't stutter .
60m,PAR,476075,478390,I probably would have stayed in science .
60m,PAR,478390,484757,but probably would have done more things where the fear of  stuttering kept me back .
60m,PAR,484757,486592,I have a_lot_of accomplishments .
60m,PAR,486592,491541,<but it's the> [//] but I think what kept me back from going  further was the fear of stuttering .
60m,PAR,491541,504351,well .
60m,PAR,504351,509560,I have a very unique perspective on that .
60m,PAR,509560,509760,because me being a leader in the national stuttering community .
60m,PAR,509760,517015,I speak to three colleges every year .
60m,PAR,517015,521961,&-um <Middle_Tennessee_University> [//]  Middle_Tennessee_State_University .
60m,PAR,521961,522161,Tennessee_State_University and Vanderbilt_University .
60m,PAR,522161,528861,I speak to the up and coming s@l l@l p@l students .
60m,PAR,528861,529061,and Monday I'm going back to Nashville .
60m,PAR,529061,537461,and Tuesday is our day to speak to the grad students at t@l s@l u@l  .
60m,PAR,537461,537661,and what I tell them .
60m,PAR,537661,546346,I tell <the s@l l@l> [//] the future SLP's to be the best advocate  that you can for your client .
60m,PAR,546346,550745,make sure that you give them the confidence that they may not get  any place else .
60m,PAR,550745,554631,and encourage them to step outside of their comfort zone .
60m,PAR,554631,563815,the most one of the most pivotal moments in my life as a person  that stutters was graduation from high school .
60m,PAR,563815,567153,I was president of the National_Honor_Society .
60m,PAR,567153,570781,and my advisor made me give &~s the graduation speech .
60m,PAR,570781,574616,and I'm saying why would she do that when she knows I stuttered .
60m,PAR,574616,574816,so but I wrote the speech out .
60m,PAR,574816,575016,I practiced it .
60m,PAR,575016,575216,and I gave it that night .
60m,PAR,575216,580931,I was nervous .
60m,PAR,580931,581131,&-um I will say I was in all white so I looked good right .
60m,PAR,581131,587781,so_that gave me some confidence .
60m,PAR,587781,591982,but I [/] I gave the speech to I guess several hundred people .
60m,PAR,591982,592182,but at the end of the speech and until this day I look back at it .
60m,PAR,592182,599199,and I said okay I know why she did it .
60m,PAR,599199,604918,the level of confidence that I gained from that night has stayed  with me for my entire life .
60m,PAR,604918,607983,she made me do something that I thought I could never do .
60m,PAR,607983,608183,and it was that pivotal moment <that has> [/] that has carried me  through my life and my career .
60m,PAR,608183,608383,<I said> [/] I said if I could do this .
60m,PAR,608383,608583,the thing I dreaded the most .
60m,PAR,608583,619171,then I could do anything .
60m,PAR,619171,619371,and it's that type of motivation and [/] and encouragement that I  try to instill in those who I talk to .
60m,PAR,619371,630068,when I talk to those who stutter personally .
60m,PAR,630068,637336,but I always tell <the s@l> [//] the future SLP's <to be that> [/]  to be that advocate for their clients .
60m,PAR,637336,643473,and be [/] be along with them as they push them outside of their  comfort zone .
60m,PAR,643473,644868,yeah .
60m,INV,199,399,&-um can you talk about the impact of stuttering on your daily life  ?
60m,INV,399,15661,you can talk about interaction with family with friends &-uh school  work your participation in community activities .
60m,INV,150352,154443,that's really [/] really interesting .
60m,INV,154443,157318,&-um what do you think causes stuttering ?
60m,INV,210705,212729,yup that's a good answer &-um .
60m,INV,212729,216056,and I love the way they both come to the same thing all the time .
60m,INV,216056,216256,&-um it seems as though you've received treatment for stuttering .
60m,INV,216256,224307,and can you tell us a little bit about &-um things that [/] that  happened and things that worked and didn't work .
60m,INV,224307,224507,that's good .
60m,INV,224507,224512,0 .
60m,INV,224512,224712,&-um now &-um when you think about what successful communication  means .
60m,INV,413002,420753,what does that mean to you ?
60m,INV,420753,420953,okay &-um if you hadn't stuttered .
60m,INV,440872,447251,if you didn't stutter what would be different in your life ?
60m,INV,447251,450668,&=laughs .
60m,INV,450668,450868,&-um so would there be anything else that you'd wanna say to  students of speech therapy or speech pathology who are going to  watch a video like this and try and learn some about stuttering ?
60m,INV,450868,451068,&=laughs .
60m,INV,451068,451268,that's great .
29mb,PAR,11643,13228,right .
29mb,PAR,13228,13428,&-um I'd say &-uh stuttering &-um kind of impacted me +//.
29mb,PAR,13428,24372,or like I've [/] I've had &-um &-uh highs and lows .
29mb,PAR,24372,27911,with [/] with stuttering .
29mb,PAR,27911,28111,&-um early on &-um definitely in my &-uh elementary school .
29mb,PAR,28111,40204,&-uh and even up into &-uh middle school .
29mb,PAR,40204,40404,&-um &-uh stuttering did [/] &-um &-uh did impact like you know  like the [/] the way that I &-um [//] you know +//.
29mb,PAR,40404,55213,certainly &-uh interacted with &-uh friends in school .
29mb,PAR,55213,67636,however like &-um you know &-uh I [/] I [/] I never really &-um  felt the full weight of that .
29mb,PAR,67636,67836,&-uh but you know that early on .
29mb,PAR,67836,73405,you know if somebody you know made fun of me .
29mb,PAR,73405,73605,on the playground .
29mb,PAR,73605,77209,you know like I was quick to defend myself .
29mb,PAR,77209,79326,make fun of them back .
29mb,PAR,79326,85847,but in high school you know that's like the full weight of  stuttering really hit me .
29mb,PAR,85847,95716,&-um &-uh but then you know beyond that in &-uh &-um the tail end  of high school .
29mb,PAR,95716,95916,going into college .
29mb,PAR,95916,100234,I finally received the &-uh proper therapy .
29mb,PAR,100234,106521,&-um I [/] I changed my relationship with it .
29mb,PAR,106521,108673,and now I'm in a &-uh better place .
29mb,PAR,108673,111241,with &-uh stuttering .
29mb,PAR,111241,116977,&-um <it has helped me> [//] it has led me to the &-uh n@l s@l a@l  .
29mb,PAR,116977,120378,you know other &-uh self help groups .
29mb,PAR,120378,130319,it has led me to pursuing &-um a [/] a [/] &-uh a &-uh career in  speech pathology .
29mb,PAR,130319,137600,&-um so &-uh <it> [//] so [/] <so there> [/] so there are some  positive aspects of stuttering .
29mb,PAR,137600,137800,in my life .
29mb,PAR,151510,157613,&-um so it [/] <it> [//] you know again just you know a broad like  lifespan view .
29mb,PAR,157613,157813,&-uh early on in elementary school I [/] I [/] I received +//.
29mb,PAR,157813,158013,&-uh you know now in hindsight .
29mb,PAR,158013,167435,knowing what I know now .
29mb,PAR,167435,170534,I received the wrong kind of therapy .
29mb,PAR,170534,170734,&-um it was more of &-uh Hooked_On_Phonics .
29mb,PAR,170734,170934,type of therapy .
29mb,PAR,170934,171134,I don't know +//.
29mb,PAR,175888,182343,you know that was the &-uh popular thing <in the> [/] in the  nineties .
29mb,PAR,182343,188444,&-um but you know &-uh obviously that turned out to not be the  treatment for me .
29mb,PAR,188444,198566,&-um and then I guess &-uh I [/] I kind of just went on throughout  school without therapy .
29mb,PAR,198566,201383,until you know again the tail end of high school .
29mb,PAR,201383,217324,when I finally you know had the opportunity to go to &-um a &-uh  &-uh &-uh facility that [/] that focused primarily on stuttering .
29mb,PAR,217324,218697,New_York .
29mb,PAR,218697,223043,&-uh the American_Institute_For_Stuttering .
29mb,PAR,223043,229547,and &-um you know that's when I just got thrown to the wolves .
29mb,PAR,229547,231163,with desensitization .
29mb,PAR,231163,236467,and &-um just changing you know again my relationship with  stuttering .
29mb,PAR,236467,241603,learning &-um you know <all the> [/] all the tools .
29mb,PAR,241603,248130,&-um you [/] you know &-uh that [/] that I could choose from .
29mb,PAR,248130,253245,&-uh to address &-uh stuttering .
29mb,PAR,253245,255815,in a way that I see &-uh best .
29mb,PAR,255815,256015,so I kind of like tried everything .
29mb,PAR,256015,263567,I was primarily &-uh focused on fluency .
29mb,PAR,263567,266135,&-um at the outset .
29mb,PAR,266135,268902,so fluency shaping tools were the ones that I tried .
29mb,PAR,268902,269102,&-um and then you know it took me a [/] you know a couple years to  realize .
29mb,PAR,269102,269302,you know again .
29mb,PAR,269302,269502,you know just speaking for myself .
29mb,PAR,269502,286445,<that you [/] you know that wasn't the the &-uh the &-uh the &-uh  tools for> [//] those weren't the tools for me .
29mb,PAR,286445,294165,&-um and so I kind of like &-uh settled with stuttering openly .
29mb,PAR,294165,299792,&-um &-um doing some of the stuttering modification techniques .
29mb,PAR,311967,320788,I'd say &-um a good successful interaction would just be getting my  message across .
29mb,PAR,320788,323112,&-uh first and foremost .
29mb,PAR,323112,331224,and I guess just not feeling like any [/] any guilt at the end of  it .
29mb,PAR,331224,331424,so by that what I mean is you know not having +//.
29mb,PAR,331424,331624,well I guess like guilt isn't the word .
29mb,PAR,331624,339934,but not having any regrets .
29mb,PAR,339934,342436,after the [/] the communication exchange .
29mb,PAR,342436,354569,so by that I mean like not &-um not &-um kicking myself for like  doing a &-uh word switch .
29mb,PAR,354569,363024,not &-um kicking myself for losing eye contact .
29mb,PAR,363024,363224,doing things that you know that I &-um +...
29mb,PAR,363224,372978,yeah you know that I would regret .
29mb,PAR,372978,373178,when the communication exchange is finished .
29mb,PAR,373178,373183,hm .
29mb,PAR,381982,396544,&-um you know again you know I'm [/] I'm fortunate to be [/] be [/]  be [/] be &-um in [/] in &-uh graduate school .
29mb,PAR,396544,399694,and you know having learned what I learned about stuttering .
29mb,PAR,399694,406663,&-um I [/] I do &-um you know agree with what &-uh researchers are  saying .
29mb,PAR,406663,406863,that you know it's a &-uh genetic +//.
29mb,PAR,406863,415348,or stuttering has genetic roots .
29mb,PAR,415348,415548,&-um &-uh I'm not sure like if +//.
29mb,PAR,415548,426417,I mean like I guess there's ongoing research now .
29mb,PAR,426417,434542,&-um &-uh investigating like what you know like what particular  genes are [/] <are being> [//] are mutated .
29mb,PAR,434542,439544,&-um you know how that links to stuttering .
29mb,PAR,439544,450617,&-um so I say the &-uh the cause is definitely &-uh genetic .
29mb,PAR,450617,460821,with neurobiological &-um &-um <reasons> [//] or like outcomes .
29mb,PAR,460821,461021,because_of that genetic abnormality .
29mb,PAR,461021,461221,yeah [/] yeah yes .
29mb,PAR,476645,481114,I [/] &-um I have .
29mb,PAR,481114,486851,&-um I don't think I would be the [/] the same person that I am  today .
29mb,PAR,486851,487051,&-um although I mean like you know like I did grow up in a you know  +//.
29mb,PAR,487051,502557,my [/] my environment I'd say you know growing up played a major  part in molding me .
29mb,PAR,502557,509793,but like I [/] I feel like a few personality traits would be  different if I didn't stutter .
29mb,PAR,509793,509993,you know maybe I'd be less &-um empathetic .
29mb,PAR,509993,521184,&-um maybe I wouldn't be &-um you know< like a good> [//] &-uh &-um  as good of a listener .
29mb,PAR,521184,524685,like I feel that I am today .
29mb,PAR,524685,524885,so like small like changes like that would be different .

29mb,PAR,606940,607140,because_of that .
29mb,PAR,607140,607340,because it's all incorporated .
29mb,PAR,607340,613178,in the &-um therapeutic process .

29mb,INV,464323,476645,&-um have you ever stopped to think what your life would have been  like if you didn't stutter ?
29mb,INV,524685,529689,okay .
29mb,INV,529689,529889,next question is the most important .
29mb,INV,529889,530089,if you had one thing to say to a future s@l l@l p@l .
29mb,INV,530089,530289,&-um who's gonna go into practice .

29mb,INV,540009,540089,okay .
29mb,INV,615662,616895,thank you .
29mb,INV,616895,618496,I'm gonna turn this off .
29mb,INV,618496,619566,and then we're gonna do the reading .
29mb,INV,619566,620363,0 .
68m,PAR,199,399,I do not allow it to impact me .
68m,PAR,6192,22022,it is something I discovered many years ago &-uh .
68m,PAR,22022,22222,and it's a part of some of the things we are hearing today with  acceptance instead of trying to fight it .
68m,PAR,22222,38471,once you've accepted it in my perspective you being to speak with  more confidence .
68m,PAR,38471,38671,it's easier and I tend to speak more fluently .
68m,PAR,38671,38871,that said there are always stressful situations that you are put  into with anxiety and stress .
68m,PAR,38871,39071,then it comes back .
68m,PAR,39071,55476,but for the most time I don't do bad .
68m,PAR,55476,55676,and &-uh so that's my perception .
68m,PAR,55676,55876,successful communication &-uh again is speaking with acceptance .
68m,PAR,55876,56076,it isn't how I'm speaking .
68m,PAR,56076,56276,it's whether I am getting my point or message across .
68m,PAR,56276,56476,well I'm older .
68m,PAR,56476,56676,I'm sixty eight .
68m,PAR,74510,75670,P;FG;1

68m,PAR,87370,89270,B;V+FG;3
68m,PAR,101191,119510,so I was going to speech therapy basically from kindergarten on .
68m,PAR,119510,119710,and in those early years .
68m,PAR,119710,119910,in the fifty's .
68m,PAR,119910,120110,the one technique they were trying at the time I believe I was in  first or second grade .
68m,PAR,120110,120310,I had a speech therapist have me put marbles in my mouth and try to  speak .
68m,PAR,120310,120510,and after you swallowed half a dozen marbles you would know +//.
68m,PAR,120510,136952,no I'm not doing this anymore .
68m,PAR,136952,149273,&-uh the last therapy I had &-uh I attended the fluency shaping  program at Hollins_College in nineteen seventy two .
68m,PAR,149273,149473,and &-uh that was the most successful .
68m,PAR,149473,161843,&-uh because up until that time ninety percent of my speech was  stuttered .
68m,PAR,161843,162043,I was twenty four .
68m,PAR,162043,162243,<and> [//] &-uh <but> [//] &-uh <I found> [//] and I think this  possibly goes into one of your other questions .
68m,PAR,162243,162443,I do not practice it &-uh because for me +//.
68m,PAR,162443,162643,and it was based on some of the research that Doctor_Webster has  done .
68m,PAR,162643,162843,that there is a clear connection with our speech patterns and &-uh  to &-uh &-uh +//.
68m,PAR,162843,163043,in his perception +//.
68m,PAR,163043,163243,and it was fairly well documented .
68m,PAR,163243,163443,the sound of our own voice gets to the other person's ear before it  gets to our own and it is the vibrations of these very minute &-uh  +//.
68m,PAR,163443,163643,something in the air .
68m,PAR,163643,163843,and &-uh he was able to prove that .
68m,PAR,163843,213387,and when we <stuttered> [//] spoke into a delayed auditory feedback  which we spoke with fluency .
68m,PAR,213387,213587,and when a fluent speaking person spoke into they stuttered .
68m,PAR,213587,213787,so there is some real correlation there .
68m,PAR,213787,213987,and I can bring it up at will .
68m,PAR,213987,214187,&-uh it is a very deliberate pace .
68m,PAR,214187,234418,you speak at a couple octaves lower and at a very slow and  deliberate rate .
68m,PAR,234418,234618,for me that didn't work because +//.
68m,PAR,234618,234818,and I think it goes hand in hand with the sound of our voice  getting to another person's ear before our own .
68m,PAR,234818,235018,it felt as_if I was talking in slow motion .
68m,PAR,235018,235218,<and I said> [//] and you really cannot show a_lot_of inflection  +/.
68m,PAR,235218,235418,"+, in your voice ."
68m,PAR,235418,255938,so oh gee .
68m,PAR,255938,256138,I just won the Maryland_Powerball .
68m,PAR,256138,256338,I just won six hundred million dollars .
68m,PAR,256338,256538,can't you tell how happy I am ?
68m,PAR,256538,266214,no [/] no !
68m,PAR,266214,266414,I would rather stutter and show the feeling and show the emotion .
68m,PAR,266414,274793,so it is what I have accepted .
68m,PAR,274793,274993,<I think> [/] I think the jury is still out on that .
68m,PAR,274993,275193,we hear all the arguments about physiological and psychological .
68m,PAR,275193,275393,and how come we can speak to ourselves .
68m,PAR,275393,275593,we can speak to pets .
68m,PAR,275593,275793,we can speak to small children and babies .
68m,PAR,275793,275993,I think it is a combination and if we don't get the treatment or we  are not made aware of the support and treatment that is out there it  is only going to continue to manifest itself .
68m,PAR,275993,276193,because this has been a personal philosophy of mine where  stuttering may not be caused psychologically .
68m,PAR,276193,276393,stuttering can cause psychological scars .
68m,PAR,282093,345728,and it stays there for years .
68m,PAR,345728,345928,it is always back there and sometimes it comes out .
68m,PAR,345928,346128,and that is my perception .
68m,PAR,346128,346328,I try not to go there as often as I did when I was young .
68m,PAR,346328,346528,it did cause me an issue in college .
68m,PAR,346528,346728,because again I was going to college in the sixties .
68m,PAR,346728,346928,and it was at the time we all wanted to save the world .
68m,PAR,354023,379596,and I wanted to go into social work .
68m,PAR,379596,379796,and my advisor &-uh advised me +//.
68m,PAR,379796,379996,because back then ninety percent of my speech was stuttered .
68m,PAR,379996,396679,and he said Subjectname xxx I really do not think you can be a  social worker effectively because_of the severity .
68m,PAR,396679,396879,so I changed .
68m,PAR,396879,397079,I got very distraught for a while .
68m,PAR,397079,397279,and then I said well what else do I wanna do ?
68m,PAR,397279,397479,so I became an engineer .
68m,PAR,397479,397679,&-so &-but &-uh &-uh to get back to it .
68m,PAR,405254,423959,do I believe I could have been more successful had I had support  earlier and there were more effective speech therapies then ?
68m,PAR,423959,424159,quite possible .
68m,PAR,424159,428746,but I have had a wonderful life .
68m,PAR,428746,430976,and I had a great job so .
68m,PAR,430976,432704,I have no complaints .
68m,PAR,432704,432904,<I absolutely> [/] I absolutely believe based on my experience  there are still a great many more things that are available for us  today .
68m,PAR,432904,433104,but I believe that the key is acceptance .
68m,PAR,433104,433304,acceptance of yourself and how you project to others .
68m,PAR,433304,433504,once you accept it for me I do not avoid any speaking situations .
68m,PAR,446431,485618,in the early seventies I became a community activist .
68m,PAR,485618,493410,I was very involved in xxx fairs .
68m,PAR,493410,495905,I became involved in state politics .
68m,PAR,495905,499114,I ran for state representative in nineteen eighty six .
68m,PAR,499114,499314,<I> [//] after that I discovered a need for stuttering awareness .
68m,PAR,499314,499514,and I started the campaign to congress for national stuttering  awareness week .
68m,PAR,499514,499714,I went down to Washington three or four times .
68m,PAR,499714,518800,spoke to committees .
68m,PAR,518800,519000,and &-uh I've had a wonderful life .
68m,PAR,519000,519200,and it has been very fulfilled .
68m,PAR,519200,529294,but the key was accepting it on my own .
68m,PAR,529294,529494,and from that time nothing has stopped me .
68m,PAR,529494,529694,I don't avoid any situation or speaking with anyone .
68m,INV,0,6192,okay so can you please talk about the impact of stuttering on your  daily life and those people around you ?
68m,INV,6192,6392,okay alright so how might you define successful communication ?
68m,INV,55476,68746,and could you give an example of what you conceive to be a moment  of successful communication ?
68m,INV,68746,90791,okay .
68m,INV,90791,90991,alright sounds good .
68m,INV,90991,91191,if you have gotten any treatment for stuttering over the years  could you tell me a little bit about it ?
68m,INV,91191,101191,sort of what happened and how you felt about it ?
68m,INV,101191,101271,right .
68m,INV,101271,101351,right .
68m,INV,101351,101431,yeah .
68m,INV,101431,101631,sounds good .
68m,INV,101631,101831,&-um now &-um what do you think ?
68m,INV,101831,102031,you sort of alluded to this .
68m,INV,274793,282093,what do you think causes stuttering ?
68m,INV,282093,282293,and but when we get in a group I can read aloud .
68m,INV,345728,350731,okay .
68m,INV,350731,354023,how do you think your life might have been different if you have  not stuttered ?
68m,INV,396679,405254,I'm sure you've done good for the world that way !
68m,INV,405254,405454,sounds good .
68m,INV,405454,405654,well there is one last question .
68m,INV,432704,446431,if you have <one message that you would like to> [//] or piece of  information that you would like to convey to clinicians in training  or to people that do not understand or know much about stuttering ?
68m,INV,446431,446631,that sounds great .
68m,INV,446631,446831,I really wanna thank you for doing this .
68m,INV,529294,537025,thank you so much .
39f,PAR,8909,16546,okay .
39f,PAR,16546,23700,so the impact of stuttering has been challenging since like since  I've gotten bullied at work .
39f,PAR,23700,28311,I'm more of a covert at like work since then .
39f,PAR,28311,42599,and at times I'm quiet due to me like not having so many friends .
39f,PAR,42599,47979,due to my stuttering speech language disorder .
39f,PAR,47979,60280,and like it's been just more like challenging and the main part of  it is that the speech therapy has been very helpful .
39f,PAR,75454,78763,okay speech therapy has been great .
39f,PAR,78763,89509,and it goes by wonderful because it like helps me to go out really  in the real world .
39f,PAR,89509,97044,to practice to do like higher avoidance like say reduction therapy  .
39f,PAR,97044,104666,techniques like ordering creating my assignments .
39f,PAR,104666,109524,and like even doing something like this .
39f,PAR,109524,109604,yeah .
39f,PAR,117848,119036,I love it .
39f,PAR,119036,127409,I love it because_of the speech therapist and the person and its  just been like been amazing .
39f,PAR,127409,128629,and like I still go .
39f,PAR,130048,137504,because if like you don't go basically it's like you like lose it  and then you will regress to being a covert again .
39f,PAR,137504,137704,I think it's maybe stress .
39f,PAR,144873,152556,and due to maybe I've had like a speech disorder all my life .
39f,PAR,152556,158927,like a speech impediment with &-like language and then I guess I  was a late talker too .
39f,PAR,160215,164389,and then everything just builds up and then I like put in fillers  too .
39f,PAR,166595,167666,as you can hear .
39f,PAR,182190,183359,okay .
39f,PAR,183359,191748,I guess communication I think means like I guess like to talk more  .
39f,PAR,192717,208476,okay and one thing I guess ↫w↫would be for me is that I do the like  whatcha_ma_call_it@c like powerpoints about the conferences in my  support like the support group .
